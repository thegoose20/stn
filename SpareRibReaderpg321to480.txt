The Moon within Your ReachELEANOR STEPHENSThe toughest problem to treat is frigidity, some say because a woman’s response is so subjective, variable, and vulnerable to so many outside factors. In any case, success depends upon the goals of the patient. Some are happy to be having sex at all. Some want the moon’ (FPA doctor, Sunday Times, September 1975).Amongst all the issues raised by the women’s movement, the feminist approach to female sexuality is one which has, for many women, completely transformed our feelings about ourselves and our lives. Just as women are questioning many of the institutions, ideas and social relations defined for us by men, so we are no longer prepared to accept traditional sexual attitudes and practices. These attitudes have for centuries kept us in ignorance of our needs and responses, and unequal and passive in our relationships with men.The implications of taking responsibility for our own sexuality reach into all areas of our lives, giving women a new sense of autonomy and power. Theorists such as Freud, Reich and Marcuse have often connected sexual satisfaction with self-actualization’ and linked sexual repression with a submissive personality structure. It is time to apply this to women. A feminist psychiatrist, Carmen Kerr, puts it this way:Taking an active role in making her sex life exactly how she wants it, is the nitty gritty of women asking for what they want in their lives as a whole. For women to feel confident and knowledgeable enough to say ‘I want more of that’ and ‘I don’t want any of that, thanks’ during sex, and so achieve her demands and needs, is a most Immediately rewarding way for her to be able to do the same with other demands in her life... In other words, I believe that for some women to break down their sexual inhibitions is a first, indispensable step in claiming power in respect to men, and ultimately the world. (Women’s Orgasm)This may sound very high flying and theoretical but, as with many of the issues of the women’s movement, the reality on which it is based is profoundly personal. Before each of us can begin to take responsibility for our individual sexuality, we have to discover for ourselves what it is that we want.My own experience of first discussing sex in a serious and open way, in contrast to nervous giggling with girlfriends at school and embarrassed exchanges with teachers, took place in my women’s group in Cambridge (Massachusetts, U S A). At that time I was living with a man with our small child and while I was aware of some problems, I was generally happy with our sexual relationship. One small ‘problem’ which I never thought worth mentioning or seeking ‘professional advice’ (I’m thankful I didn’t) was that I was never sure whether or not I had orgasms. The hot topic of the day was the vaginal versus clitoral controversy, which added to the confusion. It was an extraordinary relief to find that women in my group had similar doubts and confusions. With their encouragement, I taught myself to masturbate, and gradually learned what my body enjoyed and the sensations that I was capable of experiencing. Although it took a long time to share this with my lover, at least I knew what I was aiming at and what I needed. I also realized that I had been defining my satisfaction in his terms, and for me the climax was a feeling of empathy with his orgasm. We accepted this since it seemed that we often achieved the famed goal of simultaneous orgasm, though in fact we were both experiencing his orgasm!The following year I worked with a group of women teaching the course called ‘Women and Our Bodies’, the material for which was later published as the book Our Bodies, Ourselves. Of the ten topics covered in the course, the three which concerned female sexuality were the most popular. At the end of the last session, a shy woman in her thirties with three children came up to me to tell me how useful she had found this and how much she had enjoyed it. But could she ask me one last question: ‘What does it feel like to have an orgasm?’ For her, and how many others, I knew that we had failed. Yet we had talked frankly about childhood experiences and attitudes to our bodies, Freud and other theorists had been discussed, the Masters and Johnson work reviewed, extrovert women had compared positions that suited them best, and so on. Yet basically we’d missed the point, and it was very likely that a lot of the women coming to our groups were not experiencing orgasm. (Kinsey’s survey of 1938-49 on 5,940 women showed that 55 per cent never or rarely experienced orgasm. The 1972 Playboy Foundation study showed a decrease of only 7 per cent.) Why not and what could be done? While it was important to connect female orgasm with clitoral rather than vaginal stimulation, the crucial point was not ‘where does it happen?’ but ‘what makes it happen?’ At that time women were learning all kinds of new practical skills, like car mechanics and self-defence, and it occurred to me that if we could demystify sexuality and think of the orgasm response as a skill then we could begin to help women to learn it. And the simplest way, the way that had worked for me, was through masturbation.Two years later, in 1973, I went to work in Berkeley, California, and found that this idea had occurred to feminists there and that groups had already begun with the aim of teaching women to reach orgasm through masturbation. (Berkeley, of course, where every flat surface is a notice board, has groups on everything so this was not so surprising.) These groups, which started in 1972 and are going from strength to strength, helping hundreds of women, are called pre-orgasmic women’s groups. Pre-orgasmic rather than the medical term ‘non-orgasmic’, because this approach presupposes that every woman with a clitoris can become orgasmic given the right kind and amount of stimulation. Anyone who can learn to ride a bicycle, and this too can be a slow and fearful process especially as an adult, can learn to have an orgasm. While the term ‘pre-orgasmic’ may sound pompous, it seems to be accurate; the success rate is astonishing. A minimum of 90 per cent of the women become orgasmic by the end of the ten-week course (through masturbation) and a follow-up study showed that within four months 50 per cent of the women experienced orgasms in their sexual relationships. Many women joined these groups as a last resort having spent hundreds of dollars and hours in conventional psychotherapy, hypnosis, encounter groups, anything that offered hope. And most commonly and sadly, they would go from one relationship to another looking for the right lover who would teach them the secret of sexual satisfaction. This after all is an important aspect of the Romantic Myth of the Ideal Lover, which has prevented women from taking responsibility for their own sexuality, and maintained their dependence on men.This new definition of the female orgasm throws the clinical concept of frigidity out of the window. At a conference in Berkeley in January, a female therapist from the Women’s Sexuality Institute, one of the several organizations that run these workshops, began her speech with the rally call: ‘There is no such thing as a frigid woman!’ The entire audience, over two hundred men and women, rose to their feet and cheered. A frigid woman is one who has not had an orgasm - yet. This is the simple assumption on which the workshops are based, together with the belief that the key to achieving orgasm is through masturbation, as a Los Angeles therapist explains: ‘It’s our conviction that a woman must be in touch with her own sexuality and understand her own individual needs before she can effectively communicate to her partner her likes and dislikes, and what she finds sexually exciting. Masturbation is the best way for a woman to learn and teach herself about herself.’ By teaching women to give orgasms to themselves, literally to learn to love themselves, the whole process is demystified and orgasm is seen not as something beyond our control, something ‘done to us’ but something which we can cause to happen. With this confidence, we can then share the experience with a partner when we make love.How then are the groups or workshops organized? There are several variations but in general they follow a similar pattern based upon the method developed by Lonnie Barbach and Nancy Carlsen, two therapists who worked at the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco. Each group has two co-ordinators who lead the discussions and nor more than ten members; they meet for two hours twice a week for five weeks. The women contract to undertake one hour’s homework each day, which is essential and involves a heavy time commitment. (Five weeks of intensive work seems to be more effective than a longer period.) The techniques used come from a variety of sources: Masters and Johnson, and Lo Piccolo and Kegel, whose specific exercises for controlling the muscles of the pelvic floor are practised. Relaxation exercises and massage are an initial part of the homework helping women to explore and feel comfortable with their bodies in general, and sexual areas in particular, as a preliminary for masturbation. The first sessions introduce women to the physiological and anatomical aspects of human sexuality, about which many women are ignorant; some feel their genitals are abnormal and it is reassuring to look at pictures and to look at themselves in a mirror.Detailed discussion of the process of masturbation is introduced through several short films which have been made for this purpose. One shows a woman taking a shower, enjoying soaping herself and touching her body, then going on to masturbate to orgasm. Another film shows a woman using a vibrator. However strange this sounds, in practice the films work beautifully. They are sensitively produced and their explicitness makes them far more useful than books or lectures. (Most young boys have seen each other masturbate, but very few women have ever shared this.) Another film shows a heterosexual couple making love with both of them concentrating on the woman reaching orgasm - by manual stimulation not through penetration which is, incidentally, the most difficult way for most women to reach a climax. In this film the woman has an orgasm and the man does not, and both appear happy and satisfied with this. Women are so used to the opposite situation that it is gratifying to see an alternative. This raises discussion of the problems associated with simultaneous orgasm, a very entrenched myth, and very frustrating to women. Except in the situation where both people stimulate each other orally, it is very hard for partners to give sensitive and rhythmic stimulation when they are on the verge of an orgasm themselves. In most heterosexual situations, the man becomes distracted from the woman’s orgasm and the woman gives way to the male orgasm.Lots of time in each session is devoted to sharing feelings about sex in general and particularly about orgasm. Many women find themselves reaching a block because of all their deeply rooted fears. The fear of being out of control is very common, so that when they feel themselves close to a climax, they deliberately resist the sensations. Some worry about looking funny, or making too much noise, or not enough. Lots of these aspects of self-consciousness are relieved by the privacy of masturbation, and being able to share the worries with others in the group. We all have so many ‘shoulds’ about sex, so many imperatives which we have been socialized to accept, that it is hard to find out what we are really like. This is the importance of the hour’s daily homework; it gives women a chance to explore their own potential for sexual pleasure without pressures to conform to external standards. Many women find it hard to put aside this time for themselves because they feel that they don’t deserve the attention. This is why the group structure and the support it gives is so crucial. The process involves so much courage and trust, that without encouragement many women could not continue. The leaders, some of whom have clinical group experience, are all trained and meet together to discuss the progress of their different groups. They bring to each group the experiences of many women they have worked with, and also share their own personal feelings. In the traditions of the women’s movement, the groups are non-hierarchical and everybody is encouraged to participate.The focus of these groups is to teach women to achieve orgasm through masturbation, and only if there is time will the problems of having orgasms with a partner be discussed. (Some women may not currently be in a relationship.) Other groups now exist which deal specifically with this, and lots of women go on to these groups; while it is a great breakthrough to experience orgasm for the first time, it is only a start. Most women want to share this with their lovers. But one problem which is important to confront from the outset, since it can be a huge stumbling block, is that of the woman who has learned to fake orgasm. This is far more common than I ever supposed, though I had been aware of doing it myself on occasion. Berry Dodson, who organizes similar body workshops in New York, describes a woman called Nancy who, after six years of heterosexual relationships, had taught herself to have orgasms using a stream of water from the tap while in the bath: Nancy started a new love affair and felt confused about how to handle the sex with him. Now that she knew what orgasm was, should she tell him that she could not come having intercourse. I urged her to get her lover involved in her sexual exploration immediately and stressed the importance of not faking orgasm. Once we do that we are trapped in the biggest collective lie of them all. We must stop sacrificing our own pleasure to protect the male ego or to avoid taking sexual responsibility for ourselves.’ Nancy took this advice and fortunately her boyfriend was reassuring and explored her sexuality with her. ‘Within a relatively short period of time, Nancy was able to have orgasms several different ways: with water, with the vibrator, by hand, with oral sex, and with intercourse plus the vibrator.’Nancy’s situation was easier, but to confront the fact that one doesn’t have orgasms if one has been pretending to do so, takes a tremendous amount of courage. One woman who had been faking for five year finally explained this to her husband. He told her that she deserved an Academy Award for best actress of the century. His response was sympathetic and relevant because many women feel that when they are in bed, they are also on stage, and when the earth doesn’t move we believe it is we who have failed.Several criticisms of this approach are commonly raised during discussion and it may be helpful to try to answer some now:Isn’t all this very unromantic?Yes, it certainly is. Romanticism is largely responsible for keeping people in ignorance about sex and maintaining many of our most oppressive myths. Women have tolerated miserable sexual relationship, faked orgasms and generally kept quiet about their needs, all in the name of Romantic Love. But I do not believe that it is unromantic, in the sense of unloving or mechanical, to discuss sex with your lover. To plunge into a sexual encounter ‘spontaneously’ and just let it happen will usually be to the disadvantage of the woman. Ultimately, both people suffer if one of them is not happy and many relationships where strong ‘romantic’ attractions exist, deteriorate because of fear and ignorance of discussing ways to improve their sexual communication. Nothing in the approach described here is intended to undermine the importance of the human and emotional aspects of sex. It simply supposes that women have the right to enter a relationship on an equal basis with men, with the confidence that both people can and will have orgasms if they wish.Are you saying that women are never helped by traditional therapy and psychoanalysis?My own suspicions of psychotherapy are so deeply entrenched since I have known so many women severely damaged by this patriarchal institution, that I would almost never recommend this course. But certainly some women have been helped, although more in the sense of feeling more relaxed and open about sex, rather than in the ‘treatment of orgasmic dysfunction’ so-called. Some women may be so traumatized by their negative sexual conditioning that they require a great deal of time and attention to work through this. A sympathetic therapist (or a friend) may be helpful. But to turn to psychotherapy as a first, and often a last, resort seems to me to be expensive and usually worthless. Even the Masters and Johnson clinics which are starting over here tend to be far more helpful to men than women. They emphasize the goal of achieving orgasm through intercourse penetration rather than exploring the other techniques which are more suited to women’s sexual anatomy.These groups may work for young women who have grown up in a climate of sexual experimentation and whose sexual habits are not so set. Surely older women need more intensive help, or are perhaps beyond help?The women who attend these workshops vary tremendously in age and backgrounds. It is certainly not too late for older women to learn how to have orgasms; on the contrary, the longer the years of missing out, the stronger the motivation for making changes. Many women in their twenties and thirties are still waiting for their ideal lover to show them how, or just keep hoping that an orgasm will some day happen to them.The adjustment needed in the sexual relationship may be greater the longer it has continued. When a forty-eight-year-old woman explained to her husband what kind of stimulation she needed to reach orgasm, he objected that he was too old to change. Her response to this, which worked, was to say: ‘We’ve tried it your way for twenty-six years, why not give my way a try?’ If this sounds flippant, I would emphasize both the amount of courage it takes to make this change, and the revolutionary effect on the total relationship as a result of the increased competence and confidence the woman feels. For this woman, and for many others, her decision to take her sexual life in her hands marked the start of a new life.Only heterosexual women have these problems. Lesbians would neither need, nor be interested in these groups.About a quarter of the women in the groups are lesbian or bisexual. I was most surprised by this since I had accepted the myth that lesbians were by definition terrific lovers with none of my sexual hang-ups. This made me feel more guilty about not being gay when, in 1970, the pressure was on all ‘good feminists’ to come out and affirm their sexual allegiance. After all, how could one expect satisfactory sexual relationships with men!) This kind of myth put performance pressures on gay women, many of whom felt insecure and confused about their sexuality and have been delighted to participate in the groups. Since the basic aim of this approach is to encourage each person to take more responsibility for her own sexuality, and to start to define it for herself, women can benefit whatever their sexual bias and way of life. Incidentally, women come together who would not otherwise have occasion to meet, nor to share such personal experiences, so the groups perform a general consciousness-raising function.SR.42, December 1975
How Did We Get This Way?SUE CARTLEDGE AND SUSAN HEMMINGS If you are a lesbian, chances are you’ve spent a lot of time wondering how you got that way. Heterosexuals rarely give their sexuality a second thought. They may worry about sex and all its complications but it won’t usually have crossed their minds to ask themselves why they’re grown up heterosexual. And very probably no one has ever asked them to justify or explain it.This one-sided state of affairs, where homosexuality is seen as deviating from what is ‘natural’, accounts for the kinds of questions we as lesbians ask ourselves about our sexuality, and the kinds of answers we can come up with. If you have to start by assuming you’re the one who is different, even before you can ask yourself why and how, you will come up with different explanations than if you assume you’re ‘normal’. Heterosexual people could ask themselves all the questions raised here, but they do not unless they’re among the handful of feminists who are especially interested in the effect of social pressures on the way we develop our sexual identity. It’s not only a climate of ‘difference’ in which lesbian have to define themselves but one of almost total indifference. It’s not just, ‘Why am I like this?’ but, ‘Do I really exist at all?’ Even when people are trying to be helpful, lesbians constantly fail to get a mention: ‘We must recognize the fact that love, whether it be between a man and woman, or man and man, can achieve a pure and glorious relationship if it is expressed with restraint and discipline’ (Bishop of Southwark, June 1979).Being able to assert that you’re alive and well and lesbian often leads to becoming more interested in why it is that, despite all the counter­ pressures, and despite the conspiracy of silence on the subject, you’re managed to end up that way. Here are some of the discussions we’ve had with each other and with friends about the origins of our lesbianism. We looked at the more frequently encountered theories -some of them seem to contain grams of truth, but none are totally satisfactory. They can’t be, because they are inherited from a society which classifies us as unnatural and unhealthy.So, how did it start, how did it all begin?I’m trying, yes, I’m trying hard to findMy lesbian… origin.Baby Biothe genetic explanationThe poems which follow are verses from a song, ‘Lesbian Origin’, which Susan wrote for the Lesbian Left Revue Theatre Group, and the quotations are from conversations with Sue’s friends.Now what’s the problem, sisters?I’ll tell you what I say -It’s quite straightforward, the reason why I’m gay:Way back in the embryo I was formed that way.‘I knew I was different. I just wasn’t interested in the things the other girls were into - boys, clothes, make-up, etc. I was a tomboy. My father kept saying: “It’s time you got out of those dungarees and into a skirt.” I played a lot of sport specially netball, because I was in love with the netball teacher. I just kept falling in love with women all the time- never with men. I was very isolated. I didn’t have any images of lesbians, didn’t really know what the word meant. I just knew I was different.’Many women, both heterosexual and lesbian, remember being strongly resistant to efforts to ‘feminize’ them when they were younger - and have memories of always being different in their choice of playthings, games or friends. Many had crushes on other girls and women. Lesbians often say that they were aware, as far back as they can remember, of being strongly attracted to girls and women. But the difference for those lesbians from heterosexual women with the same memories is that lesbians placed an important emotional significance on those experiences. We didn’t ‘outgrow’ it or ‘transfer’ it on to boys. Lesbians who feel this is specially true of their history often say they were born lesbian.This was the view of Radclyffe Hall, who told the publisher of her book The Well of Loneliness (first printed in 1928), that homosexuals, ‘being from birth set apart in accordance with some hidden scheme of nature, need all the help that society can give them’. It’s an explanation which homosexuals themselves use) when they are putting their trust in the liberal tolerance of the great mass of heterosexuals.The idea that homosexuality is an innate, inherited characteristic, a       Jo Nesbittfreak of the genes, has twin advantages. It reassures nervous heterosexuals that they can’t catch it: after all, if it’s genetic, it can’t be infectious. And it allows us to say that it’s not really our fault: after all, you can’t punish us for a handicap. But there are serious and dangerous drawbacks to this explanation. It can, and has led to the views held by those who think we should be exterminated. Hitler had thousands of homosexuals slaughtered along with the Jews and other groups he considered less than human. Then there is the contemporary research featured in May of this year, on BBC’s Horizon. In ‘The Fight to be Male’ homosexuality was discussed in these terms: ‘Derner is now studying mothers in the fourth month of pregnancy, the time which he believes is the critical period... He is measuring the testosterone levels in their wombs... He follows the selected children growing up, to prove low testosterone in the womb leads to homosexuality... then the next step might be to inject [into the womb] more testosterone ­ and so prevent homosexuality’... and thus breed us off the planet, as if we were mutations.At an entirely less objectionable, though still personally painful level, these genetic arguments lead to the commonly held belief that there are two kinds of homosexuals: those who were born like it, so can’t help it, and those who were born ‘normal’- but are just plain wilful. Mother of a lesbian: ‘You want all the fun, and none of the responsibility.’ Daughter of a lesbian: ‘You could at least try to find a man. After all, you must have done it at least once.’It’s not surprising that under such pressures, many of us who do not really believe we were ‘born’ lesbian, often want to claim that we were, just to get the nagging world off our backs. Look, we say, lay off, we can’t change just to suit you. But those of us who are feminists, as well as lesbians, have a deep suspicion of all genetic theorists, knowing how often they’ve used their research to ‘prove’ that women are born inferior to men, or blacks to whites.For us, the major drawback of the total dependency biology as an explanation is that it leaves no room for the possibility of changing sexuality, or sexual practice, or attitudes toward these. And it successfully lets heterosexuals off the hook from ever having to explain their sexual selves.Psycho-Dyketheories from your dark past‘Please tell me expert therapistWhy’ve I grown up a freak?I hate being gayAnd I’m going up the creek.’‘Your mummy was too dominant,       your daddy frail and weak.But don’t despair, for help is here:        future’s not too bleak.That’s ten pounds fifty please, and       I’ll see you Tuesday week.’‘When I was five, I can remember walking with my mother down a long, dark lane to our house. And I remember saying to her, “Don’t be frightened, Mum.” I always felt very protective towards her. My father was away a great deal, and I think that’s why I’m a lesbian.’‘Psychological’ theories of the origins of homosexuality are perhaps even more popular now than biological ones. In some ways this is progress. At least psychological theories, through their examination of early relationships, pay some recognition to the idea that sexuality may not be ‘natural’ and God-given, but formed by the society we live in, and by our own particular backgrounds.Many women have found that exploring the past, through consciousness raising or through feminist therapy, has been enormously liberating, shedding light on murky private fears and lifting the burden of guilt. It has given us the opportunity to make some sense of our personal history, by discovering how much of it is similar to other women’s. So exploring our lives in this way has been very rewarding for many women, lesbian or otherwise.But in the ‘common-sense’ world outside the radical influence of feminist theory, lesbianism is still seen as a deviation from the norm. Psychology doesn’t tell us we are morally reprehensible, but the drift of the explanations it gives us is still negative: ‘immaturity’ in failing to transfer the early love for the mother on to the father; ‘mother-fixation’ resulting from a broken home or not enough love and affection in childhood. Psychology may claim to make no judgements. But lesbianism is still seen as a problem to be analysed, often an illness to be treated. In any case we can’t win. Even those rare psychologists who don’t start off by seeing us as freaks say that the pressures we have to live with will make us into freaks. Phyllis Chesler (Women and Madness, 1972) describes this trap:Most psychoanalytic theorists either sincerely misunderstand or severely condemn lesbianism. Some do both. The ‘condition’, they say, is biologically or hormonally based. No, say others, it is really an environmental phenomenon. In any event all agree, it is maladaptive, regression and infantile: even if it isn’t it leads to undeniable suffering - and is therefore maladaptive, regressive and infantile.As far as the media are concerned, psychology can be used to explain all female aberrations, not just lesbianism. Women terrorists are depicted as spoilt middle-class malcontents longing to get back at their fathers. Violence among teenage girls is the result of reversed sex­ roles, with women’s liberation to blame. And psychology is used to predict the dire results of feminism - a generation of farmed-out, nursery-reared children with no sense of security. We are all sick, unless we conform to men’s idea of femininity pretty, passive and unchallenging.The notion that those of us who haven’t conformed are strong and healthy, rather than weak, sickly deviants, hasn’t yet gained much popular appeal! Lots of people still believe that lesbians are women who, because they are too ugly to attract men, or because they’ve had bad experiences with men, turn to each other for comfort. A male Labour MP visiting a Sappho meeting exclaimed with genuine surprise, ‘But this room is full of attractive women!’ It’s true that many of us have given up the search for Mr Right. Is that a weakness? Why potter on with hope in your heart - for what might be a lifetime­ looking for that non-sexist dream man? Psychologists have seen us as battle-scarred invalids who couldn’t take any more in the rough and tumble of heterosexual competition, rather than as strong-minded realists with a positive preference for women. Lesbians have had to be        Jo Nesbitttremendously strong to resist all the pressures which insist that women search out Mr Right. So it’s hard to see why the image of us as ‘invalids’ has survived for so long.Cupid’s Dartthe romantic conversionWhy do you want to make things so very black or white?I’m not an actual lesbian, so don’t label me, all right?I just met my girlfriend at a party one night...lt’s not her sex that matters. It just feels right.‘I think I’m a lesbian because I fell in love with a woman. I suppose I could have fallen in love with a man, and I’d be heterosexual. I don’t know, because I’ve never felt that total emotional involvement with a man. But I didn’t think of myself as a lesbian - not until my girlfriend called me a “fucking lesbian”. The only images I had of lesbians were of pipes and tweeds, and I knew I wasn’t like that.’So does love really conquer all - even the massive edifice of heterosexuality? Certainly most women become lesbian through powerful romantic feelings for another woman. And such feelings (stars crossing, bolts from the blue, chemistry at work...) often seem to enter our lives from outside, sweeping us off our feet. But it’s unlikely that we just happen to fall in love. We create and nurture romantic feelings, consciously or otherwise, partly to give ourselves the chance to make emotional leaps, and to bring about drastic changes in our lives which we otherwise might not dare to make - such as straight to gay.Heterosexual romance is highly valued but, as yet, gay romance has had a mixed response In the sex education kit recently published by the Campaign for Homosexual Equality, ideas about ‘romance’ are used to get the tolerance of the straight teenager. As prime targets for romance propaganda they will surely be understanding of the gay teenager who’s only asking for the same ‘right’ of someone to love? But even the romantic explanation has not so far brought us society’s indulgence. Maureen Colquhoun’s relationship with her lover was presented in that way in a Woman’s Own article last year: ‘It’s Marvellous to be in Love Again. ‘It simply didn’t matter whether she was a man or a woman; ran the article. But it certainly did matter to Maureen’s political colleagues, who campaigned locally and nationally for her to be removed from her job as M P.... But lesbianism is a wider experience, a deeper commitment than can be contained within one individual and privatized passionate relationship. To represent lesbianism just in terms of one, or even a series, of intense romantic experiences would not account for the loving feelings which many lesbians have for women friends, and women in general. There are many celibate lesbians, who are not just waiting for the next big romance to show up. Heterosexuals do not ‘lose’ their sexuality when they are celibate. Nor is a lesbian less of one if she is not within a sexual relationship. Sexuality cannot be collapsed into sex, nor can love be contained just within romance.The Sisterhood TheoryWe came home from the meeting feeling utterly depressed.Why can’t Arthur Scargill see chat women are oppressed?Linda stayed all night: in the morning we caressed,And I realized all the loving feelings I’d suppressed...‘I began being attracted to other women as soon as I started going to women’s liberation conferences. I suppose my life had become more and more involved with women, and they seemed far more interesting than my husband, or any men, more exciting, more glamorous. And I certainly saw lesbians as the elite of the movement - as well as being very nervous of them. Looking back now, I suppose I can trace elements of my earlier life which with hindsight could be pointers to lesbianism. I was always very competitive with boys when I was a kid. I never wanted to be like my mother, stuck for years staring across a pile of dirty dishes at the neighbours’ side wall. But without the women’s movement, I just don’t know if I would ever have taken the step of becoming a lesbian. The only images I had before were of fat girls at school with spots who held hands in the back row when we had a film - I assumed they turned to each other because boys rejected them. As soon as I heard about gay liberation, and positive images of gayness, I changed my views.’This quotation isn’t necessarily typical of all the hundreds of women who’ve become lesbians ‘through the movement’. To many of us, lesbianism contained not so much a glamorous excitement, or a way out of marriage, but rather an extension of the closeness that grows up between women working together politically, and depending on each other, as well as enjoying more relaxed times. A lot of us asked ourselves, ‘If I’m feeling all these things for women, why am I keeping my sexual feelings separate?’ It began to seem like a false and unnecessary separation, forced on us by men.The history of the women’s movement both here and in the States includes a period when feminists didn’t want lesbians to be terribly vocal, in case it put other women off joining. And such attitudes still exist. In consciousness-raising groups women exchange anxieties about lesbianism, and constantly have to deal with boyfriends and husbands taunting them on the topic. And when two women do decide to become lovers, enraged husbands and all the local papers scream ‘Women’s Lib Turned Her Into A Man Hater’. It’s hardly surprising that women prefer to skate around the issue of sexual preference, except for a brief ‘Well, I don’t know, I’ve just always needed a man in that kind of way.’ Lots of women feel they have cracked sexism in their personal lives, either by finding a nice man who isn’t so hung up on conventional sex roles, or by training one not to be. But sexism is not just about sex roles and having the good luck to find your Mr Right won’t change a sexist society.... A lesbian relationship is far more threatening to the status quo than even the most radically reformed heterosexual one.‘When I first joined the women’s movement, as a heterosexual feminist, my women’s group spent most of the time talking about sexuality and relationships. We talked for hours about sex, problems with men, how we resented sex roles (like how come men have this inability to clean cookers), how we hated being whistled at in the street, how we had been shy teenagers, how men had let us down- all those kinds of things. But we never wondered how we got to be heterosexual. The question just didn’t arise. I suppose, like the rest of the world, we assumed that was the norm. So all our questioning about why a woman’s role within heterosexuality was constructed in such and such a way, never once extended to questioning heterosexuality itself.’       Jo NesbittBut even if you become a lesbian through your feminism - growing to love and trust other women, and choosing your sexuality - you still won’t escape the sexologists. It is still biological freaks plus psychological cripples versus the rest. Recent American researchers call the (relatively) chosen homosexuality of women’s movement lesbians pseudohomosexuality. According to them, if we weren’t born this way, or if we didn’t get this way because of inadequate parenting, we’re just damn phoneys.So What’s the AnswerSo, how did it start, how did it all begin?We’re trying, yes, we’re trying hard to find our lesbian origin.If only we could find it, it would be just great -Then the straights could tell us how they got so straight.So let’s think about it sisters - but where should we begin...Is it a sociological,Biological,Psychological,Astrological, or...PhenomenologicalLesbian origin?We ourselves find it hard to choose any one particular theory about our lesbianism, especially because they are all far too close, except for the Sisterhood Theory, to the kinds of ideas foisted upon us all our lives by people who wish we’d grown up ‘normal’. We certainly reject, as total explanations, all those which end up making us feel hopeless and powerless - like Born That Way, or Psychologically Disordered ­ because these only serve the purposes of those who would like us to shut up, and put up with our misfortune as invisibly as possible.... So we mainly go along with the idea that sexuality is constructed out of general social conditioning, which men control, and have done for centuries, saying what women may do and how. And within that warping culture, each of us has a particular and personal history. Like heterosexual feminists, we are clear in our minds that heterosexuality, as it is practised in our society, is a key part of the system which always benefits men. Romance, legalization of pair-bonding, raising of children within the enclosed and privatized family, are all bound together in ways which oppress women. It is through heterosexuality that most people see this whole interlinking system as ‘normal’ and even ‘natural’, a perception which for most people is so fixed that they can’t even question it.There has been considerable pressure from some gay groups over the past few years to say to the straight world, look, we’re just the same as you, we just want equal rights. This has been the main element in the campaigns of gay reformers. In many ways our lives are the same. And obviously we can’t change everything, even where we’d like to. Yet we ourselves feel that we really are different. We want to take our difference, whatever its origin, and study so we can understand it in our own terms. We think it’s up to us to say why our difference is important, and how we want to use it. It is not for heterosexuals to contain us within their oppressive and defensive definitions.Ultimately we do not want to spend too much time in the tunnel of research into our individual pasts - the possibility for changing things lies ahead, not behind. And we’ve all to some extent now come out of the tunnel with the ability to proclaim, against all odds, the potential of women to love other women, and to include our sexuality within that love. For us, ‘How did we get this way?’ isn’t a little cry of bewilderment in a hard world, but a challenge to everyone who still thinks that sexuality has nothing to do with politics, and that sexual preference is an inherited and unchangeable part of their nature.SR.86, September 1979
Physical Relationships and the Disabled WomanJULIE MIMMACKI am a tetraplegic - paralysed from the armpits downwards with partial movement in my arms and hands. I have some feeling in my legs and torso generally, but no voluntary movement. I am confined to a wheelchair and am twenty-four years of age. My injury was caused by a car accident seven years ago and although the muscles which function are stronger than before, there have been no other physical improvements.... Social encounters at parties or other functions are obviously varied. But in my experience they do follow certain patterns.a) Complete RejectionIn such cases even eye-to-eye contact is impossible. People get embarrassed, but sometimes they’re just indifferent - you’re written off. I ignore them back or, if I don’t like their remarks, I speak back in kind. I’ve got a loud mouth and I’m not prepared to huddle away in corners. There’ve been a few feet I’ve run over with my wheelchair too.b) Over-EnthusiasmThis may be caused by over-drinking or whatever. You may be treated as a ‘plaything’ or a ‘novelty’. The fact that you may be the only wheelchair-bound guest can draw excess attention, not so much for your ‘self’ but your ‘predicament’. This may only temporarily boost the old ego; if you should so want it boosted!c) AdmirationThis can be beneficial or otherwise. Personally I have found this coming from older men (usually married) and those with heart-rending tales to tell; breakdowns, marital hang-ups, etc. (as if you haven’t got enough of your own). Admiration also seems to make the female a target for ‘religious salesmen’. Often promises are made at the end of what may seem a fruitful evening. But will you ever see him again? Even if sincere at the time, parties can be a superficial basis for a relationship. There are many obstacles to come.A sexual relationship can be extremely difficult. Especially if the disabled female lives at home with parents - as I do - and is of the age when hopefully she would be living independently, working and travelling. Parents can be over-protective, especially if you are dependent on them both physically and financially. They may interrogate your partner more than in normal circumstances; after all, you are more vulnerable to maltreatment. Nonetheless, you are unable to create your own atmosphere in such a situation- making coffee, or generally ‘moving around’. There is also that first moment when ‘bladder management’ is revealed. It would seem that this is the real rest. How will he react to a mature individual who wears plastic knickers and pads and requires help when going to the loo? Rejection on this count can be very grim and frustrating.... A successful sexual relationship would seem impossible to define (whether disabled or not). If you are praised, there is always a feeling of doubt; no one can really convince you of sexual prowess when half your body isn’t really normal- however this may be defined. You may also worry about your body-shape. Many disabilities come equipped with drooping breasts, a thin rib-cage, not to mention a lax tum, due to lack of muscle-tone. You may compare your body-shape with how it was prior to disability. And wonder whether your partner is comparing your body to someone else’s. In either case, discussion can help.... When / if your relationship passes the ‘bladder test’ the next hurdle is arranging a private meeting (place and time). ‘Time’ is a leading factor here because a) a considerable amount of physical preparation is required and b) unexpected visitors or disturbances are impossible to cope with - the disabled party can’t quickly get up, dress, wash. When sexually aroused, the heat can be taken out of the moment when your partner has to help you empty your bladder and carefully clean and position you. This can cause a mechanical barrier. On the other hand things can be taken in a light-hearted manner, which helps. During and after sexual intercourse, over-exhaustion can make the disabled woman feel inadequate. The mind may be very willing to try our new positions and experiences, but the body function can be that much weaker.... ‘Is your partner a nurse-cum-nancy?’ This concept annoys me on two counts: the way that it is put forward by many people implies a distinct prejudice against homosexuals, and that it is ‘unnatural’ for a male to take on the ‘caring’ role - caring goes against the male macho image. It would seem to be a recognized fact, from experience (sorry, no statistics as yet), that disabled women have a greater chance of pairing up with able-bodied men. Hopefully with greater sexual equality, the introduction of more male nurses, and different attitudes, this will no longer be the case....To conclude I would say that if barriers can be broken down and a relaxed relationship achieved, one of the greatest outcomes is confidence. Both in oneself and with others.S.R.86, September 1979
The Feelings behind the SlogansEILEEN FAIRWEATHER‘Soon motherhood became a thing to be shunned and feared. I confess that when well-meaning friends said: “You cannot afford another baby; take this drug”, I took their strong concoctions to purge me of the little life that might be mine. They failed, as such things generally do, and the third baby came...’So wrote one mother, in Maternity: Letters from Working Women. First published in 1915, these statements by members of the Women’s Co-operative Guild are a powerful and moving record of their authors’ suffering and courage. Denied contraception and abortion by Church and state, and bodily freedom by their husbands, they tell of how, ‘practically as soon as the birth is over, she is tortured again. If the woman does not feel well she must not say so, as a man has such a lot of ways of punishing a woman if she does not give in to him.’Their yearly pregnancies meant terrible injury. Many, of course, did not survive. Only a little over fifty years ago, my own grandmother died in childbirth. ‘Puerperal septicaemia’ is the recorded cause, a fancy term which says nothing of the conditions she gave birth in. Which was, like most women of the time, in poverty, without the help of midwife or doctor and with a body made weak through undernourishment and overwork. She died having my mother, only eleven months after her last labour. Twins that time, neither of whom lived longer than six weeks. The good old days.When you wash away the centuries-old gobblygook about sacred motherhood, sacred infancy, the truth- at least in our culture- is that the generation of women now in their twenties and thirties are the first ever to be able to view pregnancy with something less than stricken fear. Today, only twelve women in 100,000 die through childbirth, compared with the one in 250 of fifty years ago. Medical men and male legislators would have us believe this is entirely due to their pioneer policies and technology. But whatever women have gained, we have had to fight for it every inch of the way.The women of the Co-operative Guild had to campaign for decades to win the maternity grant, and statutory maternal care. Birth control campaigners were prosecuted, imprisoned and fined; in the 1880s, Annie Besant even lost custody of her child for the ‘obscenity’ of providing other working-class women with information on birth control. In the absence of that, many more, nameless women went to prison for helping their sisters procure abortions. The women in the Middle Ages who performed abortions, and helped women bear children less painfully, were known as ‘wicca’, or wise women; wicca is the Anglo-Saxon for witch, and ‘wise woman’ is still the French term for a midwife. The Church had nine million of these women tortured and killed.... The 1967 Abortion Act was a concession of the liberal sixties, granted because over 3,000 women a year were being admitted to hospital with septic wombs. The MPs who voted for safe and legal abortion never realized, however, how great the demand would be. They estimated 10,000 abortions a year; currently, the figure is over 100,000. So now, for the third time in four years, a bill is in Parliament aimed at restricting abortion to the truly ‘deserving’. It was drafted by Sir George Crozier, the chairman of the ‘Pro-Life’ co-ordinating committee, who don’t believe any women at all have the right to abortion. They estimate that the bill will reduce successful applications by two thirds.... While our elected ‘representatives’ (616 men, 19 women) strain that are consciences over abortion, women have already had to cast their vote. From the statistics available on legal and illegal abortion over the past fifty years, probably one woman in six has had an abortion.Why, then, don’t all these women come forward to defend a woman’s right to choose? The National Abortion Campaign has initiated a Campaign Against Corrie, new groups are being formed, old ones revived, a petition is being circulated and the T U C have called an autumn demonstration. But for many feminists there’s a feeling of deja vu. Partly, that’s exhaustion. More worrying is the number who fear that the pro-choice movement cannot win the support of women overall because it does not actually reflect their experience. The women’s movement was still very young when abortion first became a political football. We duly kicked back and, faced with the opposition’s set of slogans, defensively came up with our own. In our rush to do that, the complexity of abortion and its emotional significance for women somehow got lost.A basic feminist idea is that ‘the personal is political’, but some feminists have taken that to mean that all you can, or should do, is change your own lifestyle e- eliminate the worst aspects of sexism from your life and friends. Others have argued that women can never be free on an individual level if they can’t, for example, get equal pay, or nurseries for their kids. So these feminists moved into campaigns. Still others have said: and what are women supposed to do while we wait for this ‘revolution’ or, more likely, a few measly reforms? They therefore set to creating alternatives for women in the here-and-now, such as refuges for battered women, collective nurseries and rape crisis centres.... It is partly from this split that I believe N A C has suffered. The National Abortion Campaign is the only nationally organized campaign the British women’s movement has apart from the National Women’s Aid Federation. Although there are hundreds of women’s groups scattered over the country, co-ordination is minimal. Formal structures, it has always been argued, would make the movement impersonal and hierarchical. We would become just like the male ­ dominated Left - capable only of ‘responding to issues’ and not to the human experience behind them.But when the James White bill appeared in 1975, many feminists felt the urgency and severity of this threat meant we had to fight in a coordinated and national way. Women’s groups acting in isolation from each other could not organize demonstrations, petitions, lobbies of parliament and publicity in the press. Efforts would be duplicated, some areas left totally untouched, and in the absence of any visible opposition the bill would zip straight through.Without N A C, I believe that would have happened. But the doubts feminists have about formal structure have in many cases been proved right. My worry is that the critics have never been able to provide any alternative model for effective campaigning.Instead, women in N A C were accused of being male-identified, for drawing women away from consciousness-raising groups. My reply then was that I didn’t want to raise my consciousness if it was only so that I could stay calm on some backstreet abortionist’s table. I still feel pretty much the same, except that I acutely regret the polarization was ever necessary. Because political activity without constant renewal of our feminist anger, caring and understanding quickly becomes counter­ productive. Yet the women who are left to shoulder the work of meetings and leaflet-writing inevitably have less time for looking at the deeper issues.One major fear of ‘structure’ was swiftly confirmed- the Left spotted it and moved straight in. Soon women members of left groups were prominent in N A C. As an ex-member of a left group, I’ve never found it helpful to witch-hunt along the lines of ‘which leftie is really a feminist and which isn’t’. What is objectively true is that all left organizations are male dominated, both in numbers and ideas, so even those genuinely feminist women in them are constantly worn down. Traditional socialism claims that economics alone provides the ‘real’ explanation for women’s oppression. Any mention of men, as individuals, benefiting from the subjugation of women, is therefore sidestepped.... Certainly we need labour movement support. Sending giant knitting needles to MPs might stir a few consciences, but are lying on the conscience of your rulers is a dodgy thing. I would love to see the day when the enormous power of organized labour works for feminism with, say, an all-out political strike for a woman’s right to choose. We’d be hitting where it hurts, straight in the money-bags.Unfortunately, that day is a long time off. In the meantime, we’ve got the 28 October anti-Corrie march, the first-ever demonstration called by the T U C in support of a feminist demand. That in itself is a victory. Even five years ago, a woman who raised abortion in her trade union or Labour Party branch would have been greeted with shocked silence or outright derision.If the ideas of yesterday’s ‘loony extremists’ are now firmly on the political agenda, it is because the women in N A C have worked hard to put them there. But getting those ideas ‘taken up’ shouldn’t mean we also let them be taken over. Whenever abortion is, for example, primarily argued for on the basis of defending ‘a woman’s right to work’, only half the story is being told. Nothing is being said about the effect fear of pregnancy has on women’s sexuality; nothing about the power men gain over women through forced pregnancy; nothing about the fact that some women have abortions simply because they don’t want children. And, every time we look at abortion mechanistically, we risk alienating those who have reason to care about it most - other women.Anyone who’s ever petitioned for N A C knows that the person who practically pulls the pen from your hand to jab down a signature is usually a woman - and an older one. Two minutes later she’s back to tell you of her own experience; the pompous doctor who first humiliated then refused her; the breakdown after the child she didn’t want; and most horrific of all, the tales of quinine and penny royal, umbrella spokes and needles.Yet for every woman like this there are many who simply clam up at the sight of our placards and brusquely walk away. They are not openly hostile, so I’ve often wondered if these are the women who, in a sense, care most passionately about abortion - precisely because they’ve had one themselves. What we seem to forget is that women in their thousands won’t come flocking to our demos when so many have never even talked to anyone of their own experience. The antis have ‘God and right’ on their side; we have a legacy of shame, secrecy, and often pain which goes so deep you can’t even bear to think about it - much less fight back.That vital ‘consciousness-raising’ clement is missing from our campaign. When the anti-abortion Lifeline argue that ‘each abortion is a defeat’, they are right in the sense that it’s an experience any woman would rather do without. Our difference would be in arguing that being forced to bear a child against your will is an even bigger defeat. But still it’s something of a Hobson’s choice.In our propaganda, however, there is a tendency to pose abortion as though it were an end in itself. ‘Free abortion on demand’, the second demand of the women’s liberation movement, has something of that ring; the trouble with all slogans, of course, is that they are shorthand for something more complex, but I know my ‘Abortion- a woman’s right to choose’ badge always produced more sympathetic chats on the bus. And we’re pretty lazy about using the phrase ‘pro-abortion’ rather than pro-choice.Our opponents prey upon the emotional effects of abortion, so we play them down. Both sides hurl around statistics about post-abortion depression and, in the process, any feel for what is a unique and solitary experience for each woman is lost. This self-censorship limits our campaigns and, just as importantly, it abuses us. One feminist found herself totally unprepared: ‘I was stunned by my reaction. I never thought I’d want kids and I found I wanted this one. When I got home from hospital and my friends had gone I just rolled about the floor howling, “I wanted it, I wanted it.” I even phoned the Samaritans. But a middle-aged man, although comforting, took a standard line. “You’re not married, you haven’t got a permanent job and you didn’t feel able to tell your boyfriend. Don’t crucify yourself, you have made the right decision.”‘ But Debbie thinks circumstances made the decision for her, and ‘what I feel now almost more than sadness is resentment... we’ve a long way to go before a woman’s right to choose can mean anything.’N A C rightly says that women must have ‘access to free, safe birth control; community-controlled childcare facilities; paid maternity leave; increased child benefit and more financial support for single parents ... to enable a realistic choice’. But this doesn’t come out clearly enough in the work of campaign, perhaps because the women’s movement as a whole hasn’t gone far enough in fighting for motherhood to be less oppressive than it is now. At the last socialist feminist conference, for example, there wasn’t even a workshop on childcare until mothers themselves organized one.The antis use such emotive arguments about motherhood and childhood that we again react defensively. They talk of killing life, and speak of every foetus as a baby. In response, N A C says the foetus is a potential human life, incapable of independent existence (my italics). Another much-used slogan is ‘An egg is not a chicken, an acorn is not a tree, a foetus is not a baby, so don’t lay that on me.’Why do we have to make support for a woman’s right to choose dependent on seeing the foetus as no more than a bunch of splitting cells? In doing so, we lose many potential supporters, and that includes those women who have had an abortion, but think of it as killing. Some women experience nothing but relief after an abortion. Others only feel guilty because they don’t feel guilty. But for many women, it’s not so simple: ‘I love children so much. It makes it even harder when you already have a child. This time I couldn’t help thinking it was a human being, a living being. If you asked me how I felt about abortion, I would say I was against it. I feel very hypocritical.’The ‘potential’ human life argument implies that she is merely suffering from feminine fancy and sexist conditioning. It may seem the most ‘revolutionary’ position, but it is not pro-woman. How can it be, when it denies women’s experience?According to one Australian study, 60 per cent of women believe life begins at conception (compared with 36 per cent of men). That doesn’t stop them having abortions. Countering S P U Cs quasi-science with our own quasi-science is, to me, to argue in a very rational, masculine way. The only way abortion will cease to be each woman’s guilty secret, and become something she is prepared to fight for publicly, is through our saying, without apology- yes, if necessary, we put women first.... In our fight for abortion rights, we need to stress continually that what women really need is safe and adequate contraception - 75 per cent of abortions are due to contraceptive failure. Nominally the male Left will happily go along with this because, like abortion, it fits in with their emphasis on fighting cuts and making demands of the state. Compared to rape or woman-battering, fertility control must seem a less threatening issue; the implications of sexism can more easily be concealed. But one important element is neglected - how the hell do they think women get pregnant in the first place? Increasingly, women are rejecting the Pill and IUD for contraceptive methods with fewer side-effects, but more scope for human error. How many men take equal responsibility in contraception? ‘Liberated’ men are often the worst offenders. Yet this aspect is hardly ever mentioned in our campaigns.Is it from fear of being labelled ‘man-haters’ that we iron out any mention of sexism... or is it the effect of working with men? Our interests have too often been opposed by men for us to allow them anything except an auxiliary role in our campaigns. Yet recently a feminist was shocked to find, at a meeting called by Southwark Labour Party to set up a local Campaign Against Corrie, that ‘of the sixty-odd people present, about two thirds were men. I sarcastically asked where were their wives -at home looking after the kids? - and, without any irony, a man complacently said he supposed they were.’ When she challenged this set-up, and the fact that men were elected on to what she felt should be an all-woman steering committee, she was roundly condemned for seeing abortion as a women’s, instead of class issue.... If we do not want our demands to be co-opted, we must battle to change support into the kind we need. Equally, we don’t need to be tied by the rules of any new-found friends. With abortion, we could usefully heal the rift between those feminists who put their energies into campaigning, and those who prioritize creating alternatives.If the laws are changed, we will have no choice but to learn how to perform abortions. The menstrual extraction method, pioneered by American feminists, is performed a few days after a period is overdue, and before a woman can even tell for certain whether she is pregnant.Learning to perform abortions could also be a major political weapon. One strong reason why abortion was legalized in France and Italy was that women were defying the law en masse, through feminist­ organized underground abortion networks.Feminists have wanted to challenge previous bills with the open threat that, if the law was changed, we’d break it. But it was felt that we should hold that card until our backs were really up against the wall. Which is precisely where we are now.There are enough nurses and medics who are feminists, or sympathetic to us, for a safe, illegal abortion network to be a reality. We have to let our rulers know now that we’re prepared to flout their laws if forced. The law is considered sufficiently sacred in Britain for any threat of mass disobedience to be taken very seriously indeed - God knows, it might lead to all other kinds of anarchy.We must use every weapon we can. That includes petitions, writing to MPs, demonstrating - but it does not have to top there. Feminists in Italy took over hospital clinics and performed their own abortions; self-help and political protest combined. The suffragettes had even less mobility and independence than us, but they still wreaked havoc through the length and breadth of the country.To pin all our hopes on persuasion through demonstration would be false. Nonetheless, a powerful feminist contingent on 28 October is vital. We can organize with a sharp eye to publicity, and make it a demo they have to report. Women in Mexico marched in black; around their waists, they wore syringes and catheters, the implements which killed the sisters they mourned. Those feminist actions which have been imaginative and defiant- Reclaim the Nights, the blocking of Fleet Street, the occupation of Westminster Cathedral - have all won considerable publicity.Obviously we have to find other ways to organize and campaign. If we are prepared to look beyond the slogans, that can only help us. Our commitment to abortion rights should not mean we have to suppress our own or other women’s experience. It is, however, maybe worth recalling how we got pushed into that defensive position in the first place:‘The Consultant pulls off his gloves, pulls down my lower eyelids and glares in to my eyes.- There is no medical reason why you shouldn’t have this baby. Just because you don’t think you want it, why should I have to kill it?I keep hoping he might notice the look on my face. I live on social security, but have a place in college in September. If I have another child it will mean another five years of just waiting, living day to day...But, he tells me, if I want to live my life so badly I should have made care I didn’t get pregnant.However. There is some hope, as a private patient... have I no way of borrowing some money?I run, sick, disgusted with his fat, well-fed face. Scared I might spit at him or hit out with my fists. He calls me back, but I can’t bear it if he sees my tears, coming out of an anger I am impotent to express...’One woman’s experience, under the law as it is now.SR.87, October 1979
If the Cap FitsROZSIKA PARKER ‘I hate using the diaphragm. It robs me of spontaneity. It makes me feel self-conscious, over-responsible, messy.’That was the response I expected when I asked women to describe their reactions to returning to the diaphragm- a form of contraception they thought they had abandoned years ago, along with roll-ons, sanitary towels and stilettos. But though some said they resented the cap, others welcomed it back. It all seemed to depend on an individual’s attitude towards her own body, towards her sexuality and on the state of her personal relationships.Recent surveys have come out in favour of the diaphragm or cap. Professors Martin Vessy and Richard Doll at Oxford University in a long-term study of contraceptive methods found that the pregnancy rate for the cap was less than one quarter as high as was previously thought and the cap appeared to protect against cancer of the cervix. But that still leaves the Pill as the most secure contraceptive; 0.14 per cent of women on the Pill in their study became pregnant in a year, compared to 2.4 per cent with the diaphragm. But contraceptives carry risks other than unwanted pregnancy. In 1976 Dr Christopher Tietze published the results of a statistical analysis of different methods of birth control based on a mass of recent evidence from the U S A and Britain which revealed that women of all ages risk death least by using the diaphragm or condom backed up by early abortion if they become pregnant. However, the women I spoke to switched from the Pill or the IUD not from fear of death but because their contraceptive was disrupting their lives.Some found that the IUD gave them impossibly long pre-menstrual tension and heavy periods. Some abandoned the Pill because they felt they had interfered with their body chemistry for long enough. Others simply couldn’t find a Pill that suited them. Andrea said, ‘I tried loads of different kinds but my body always swelled up and I felt terrible. Finally the woman at the clinic said “You know the answer for you ­ abstention” and I decided that the time had come for me to demand a diaphragm.’ Her sister Lisa had a similar experience on the Pill: ‘I felt sick all the time. Nobody at the clinic told me why. They’d just hand me another variety of pill.’Three million women take the Pill according to the F P A, compared to only a quarter of a million who use the diaphragm. Andrea asked resentfully why she should be forced to use the oldest form of contraception on the market. Why wasn’t more intensive research being done to develop a completely safe and satisfactory contraceptive?The cap does have a long history. The spring-ringed diaphragm, invented by a Dutch feminist in 1880, was the descendent of the half ­ lemons, balls of opium, discs of beeswax, vinegar-soaked sponges and rubber or metal cervical caps with which women had improvised for centuries.In fact it was the very history of the diaphragm which endeared it to another recent convert I spoke to. She said she identifies with it because ‘it was invented to help free women, and distributed among women by women like Marie Stopes.’ She sees the Pill, on the other hand, as ‘bound up with professionalization and secrecy’.Getting pregnant is the major worry amongst diaphragm users: ‘There’s that corner of doubt in your mind the whole time which you don’t have with the pill.’ The pill is 99.9 per cent reliable, the IUD 98 per cent and cap and spermicide 97 per cent, according to the F P A, but they add that reliability very much depends on whether or not you are a ‘regular and practised user’.Failure is usually due to:Improper fitImproper careInconsistent useDiaphragm slipping because of expansion of the vagina during intercourse; too much spermicide on the rim making it slippery; the penis getting behind the diaphragm, said to happen more easily if the woman is on top.Diaphragm ring bending due to constipation - a Harley Street gynaecologist commented that this caused the only failure he had come across.The largest contemporary survey of users, carried out in New York from 1971-3, showed that only 2 per cent of more than 2,000 women had an accidental pregnancy. Failure rates were lowest among women under eighteen years (1.9 per 100), and among women aged thirty-five and older there were no accidental pregnancies.The researchers attributed the success of the diaphragm to the way in which women were taught to use it. Complete confidence with it depended on whether they had been thoroughly informed.With such a simple technique it would seem almost impossible for women to come away from clinics clutching their diaphragms and a whole lot of unanswered questions. But even amongst the small number of women I interviewed, there were some disturbing stories.Take the case of Sally. She became pregnant while using the cap due entirely to the casual attitude of the university clinic in Sydney, Australia, which provided her first diaphragm. They gave her an inspector and never told her to check with her finger to see that the diaphragm was in place. They neither supplied her with spermicide nor told her that the diaphragm should never be used without spermicidal cream or gel.Rachel came away from a London clinic worrying which way up the device should be worn; dome up against the cervix or pointing down. Most clinic workers say ‘dome upwards’ but that you can decide which is most comfortable for you.Alice had a more serious difficulty. Her retroverted womb makes it hard for her to remove her cap. In some women the top end of the womb is tilted so that there isn’t a straight passage from the mouth of the vagina to the cervix. The clinic she attended gave Alice no specific advice about this and home on her own she found she couldn’t get it out. ‘I went back to the clinic and poured out all my anxieties and problems. Eventually they became really clear, treating me like an idiot and saying, “You are an anxious person, aren’t you.” It’s only by being labelled an anxious person that you actually get any communication. They told me to lie in the bath if I had trouble removing it. Wrestling around in the bath with my legs up to the ceiling and using two fingers to hook it down, I can manage to get it out.’Margaret had a rather bizarre experience when her cap was fitted. She was taught how to insert it but the hurried, overworked nurse checked her anus to see if Margaret had put it in correctly. The nurse was so embarrassed by her error that she never completed the instructions. For three years Margaret was lucky, then she got pregnant.Of course most fitting sessions are efficient and uneventful. In the USA paramedical staff are being trained to fit diaphragms in women’s health centres. Adele Clark writing in Country Woman, March 1976, describes the importance of being fitted by her ‘friendly paramedic Nancy’ at a women’s clinic. It shaped her attitude to the diaphragm: ‘We tried one kind and it wouldn’t fit; we tried another and we both could get it in and out. Success. The word we is crucial. I was a participant, not a patient or a victim in this process of fitting my diaphragm, just as I am when I use it to prevent conception.’I wondered whether a woman’s attitude towards her body affected the extent to which the diaphragm is acceptable. Most said yes, it was an important factor; sometimes in perfectly obvious ways, other times in ways they couldn’t fathom.One or two said that attempts to use the diaphragm had been directly hampered by their inhibitions about touching themselves. But women who had masturbated since childhood had no such problems, and Jo said that touching herself ‘in order to put all in seemed like part of in history. I suppose your own history reflects the kind of contraceptive you’ll find acceptable. I don’t enjoy someone watching me put the cap in though and that can be tricky since I would never dream of going to the bathroom to do it - so to some extent it must represent a continuation of the privacy of my masturbation.’Diaphragm use seems also to be bound up with the self-hatred that for so many women becomes focused on their bodies. Mary tried to express this: ‘I see my body as an enemy, an alien area trying to do me down by not conforming to the fashionable shape. When I’m feeling particularly fat, I simply can’t put in my diaphragm. I mean how can I prepare my body for pleasure when I hate it, let alone prepare it to provide pleasure for someone else.’Feminists often feel that the diaphragm enhances their sense of owning their own body- that it exists for them independently of bringing pride to their parents, pleasure to their lover or income to an advertising agency. Margaret commented, ‘I need to say my body’s mine. The diaphragm is a physical symbol of my control of my own life.’ This theme is developed in Erica Jong’s Fear of Flying: ‘Pregnancy seemed like a tremendous abdication of control. Something growing inside you which would eventually usurp your life. I had been compulsively using the diaphragm for so long pregnancy could never be accidental for me.’Insertion can provide a sense of self-assertion which somehow can’t be obtained by swallowing a pill. But the emphasis on control carries defensive overtones of fear, both a need for protection and a struggle for independence. Erica Jong continues, ‘The diaphragm has become a kind of fetish for me. A holy object, a barrier between my womb and me.’Most women, far from valuing the diaphragm as a last line of defence, complained that it inhibited their sexual spontaneity. Alice would like for once to be able to ‘fall into bed without thinking whether or not I want sex, whether or not he’s satisfying me. I want to be bowled over.’ The diaphragm interferes with such fantasies and Alice’s resentment gets directed towards her partner: ‘Spontaneity is allowed to him but not to me. I get strange feelings of anger about preparing myself for his needs. I always have to look after myself - he wouldn’t bother. He didn’t respond to my heavy hints about sheaths - he didn’t like them. I feel men aren’t concerned or interested in women’s worries about contraception.’But other women reported that their partners had no objections to sheaths. Some couples share responsibility for contraception by alternating cap and sheath, others use both together for extra security. Alice continued, ‘I remember getting angry the first time we slept together because in the morning we started fucking again and I suddenly remembered you have to put more cream in. He didn’t remember, or didn’t know, so I was the one who had to interrupt the lovemaking to leap out of bed and be embarrassed. Then I couldn’t get into it again - thought he’d find me repulsive or something.’Some women felt that complete openness was a solution. They incorporate the cap into lovemaking, but Sally discovered a drawback: ‘You put it in in front of him or he helps you put it in. You both get covered in goo and by then you are so bored with the whole process that all you want to do is go to sleep.’Not everyone minds the diaphragm’s inconvenience. For Jo, the check on spontaneity isn’t a problem. Comparing the Pill and the diaphragm she found the Pill ‘coercive. It was developed to enable women to be sexual at any time, but to me it was like a statement that I had to be sexual at all times. The Pill seemed less to do with not getting pregnant than with being sexually available.’Rosemary completely disagreed. Far from giving her permission to be sexually discriminating, she finds the diaphragm hopelessly limiting: ‘You have to decide in advance not just whether you are going to have sex, but what kind of sex you are going to have. Nobody else seems to have a problem with oral sex but I’m not prepared to inflict it on anybody - it tastes horrible. And Delfen made me ill it smelled so terrible.’ Margaret, however, ‘actually felt touched that he was prepared to swallow mouthfuls of the stuff for my sake’.It’s worth experimenting with different creams or gels (which are more lubricating) to see which you find least off-putting. Some spermicides contain mercury. Mercury can be absorbed through the vaginal walls resulting in damage to the kidneys. So read the label of the spermicide you use, avoid those containing phenyl mercuric acetate (PMA), and stick to those that don’t, Ortho Gynol Jelly, Ortho Cream, Rames Jelly and Delfen cream and gel.None of the spermicides are delightful and women say that we should demand better-tasting spermicides. But manufacturers would probably respond with stereotypically rose-scented or apple-blossom products.On the subject of manufacturers, Sarah Calvert suggests in the New Zealand magazine Broadsheet No. 40 that ‘A lot of preconception about the diaphragm (it’s messy... it’s a hassle... it’s always a failure) are tied to the campaigns by drug companies and others to promote ‘easy’ contraception. Easy contraception does not exist.’Nevertheless, the basic inconvenience of the diaphragm is inescapable, though MS magazine, Vol IV, No.2, does quote studies showing that reapplication of spermicide and the ‘rule’ about not putting the diaphragm in more than two hours ahead of time are nor necessary as spermicides retain their strength for twenty-four hours regardless of the number of ejaculations. But until the debate is resolved it seems wisest to follow traditional directions.Lisa suggested lessening the practical inconvenience by leaving an applicator full of spermicide beside your bed at night or keeping your diaphragm in your bag with a generous supply of tissues. And she pointed out that the diaphragm lessens one specific inconvenience - making love with a period.The cap made some women feel furtive, and they behaved accordingly: ‘I can’t even bring myself to show him what it looks like,’ said Sue, afraid that its functional, clinical character might put off her partner. Mary had similar anxieties with ironic results that left her outraged: ‘I groped my way back to bed from the bathroom with damp hands and cold feet only to find him tolled over against the wall, complaining, “It turns me right off when a woman sneaks off to the bathroom to get ready.”'Jo, on the other hand, found that the practical routine of diaphragm use helped to dispel a strong sense of sexual guilt. She felt that ‘the cleaning ritual, particularly in a shared living situation, had a very good effect on me. It went some way towards undermining the association of sexual feelings with dirt and mystery. I think this has something to do with the diaphragm being visible and tangible.’Margaret too sees advantages in the practical routine demanded by the cap. ‘It means I have to make a conscious decision as to whether or not I want to make love. It makes me feel I control my sexuality.’Alice is dubious about such decision-making power. Rather than enabling her to express her own needs and desires, having to decide about the cap creates all kinds of fears and conflicts. She admits she wants ‘to abdicate from making decisions about whether I want sex or not - it’s too loaded. I don’t want to say “no, I’m not sexual today" because it might turn out not to be true, and it’s risky - you might get rejected for hurting his feelings. Nor do I want to say “Yes, I definitely do feel sexual.” I might then be making a demand to be satisfied, taking a very risky initiative. The decision to put in the cap or not comes to symbolize these conflicts.’Similarly, though Sally has intellectually rejected women’s role as the passive person who waits to be asked, emotionally she’s immobilized at the prospect of taking the initiative: ‘If you reach for your cap it’s almost like saying “we are going to fuck tonight” and I find that a pressure.’Jane felt much the same. The cap makes her increasingly aware of the chasm between men and women that rigid sex roles create. ‘I find it really difficult even to take my diaphragm with me when I go to see him. He lacks sexual confidence to the extent that he’s immediately threatened if he thinks I’m being sexually demanding.’Some cap users say these difficulties can be overcome if it’s inserted at night atomically ‘like cleaning your teeth’. Then the cap gets divorced from sexuality. I heard of one woman who kept her cap in all the time, removing it every 24 hours to clean it.Most women agreed that the diaphragm is easier to use within a long-term relationship but added that obviously a lot depended on the quality of the relationship. One woman said resentfully that her husband checked to see if she had taken it with her when she went away. Another became convinced that her husband was about to prick holes in her cap. ‘When sex goes sour; Mary said, ‘the resentment you feel towards your partner is projected on to your cap.’ And Alice, looking back to her marriage, said that the diaphragm made her confront the fact she no longer enjoyed sex with her husband. ‘When you’re on the Pill it’s easier to have sex than not.’All the women’s feelings about their cap were shaped by whether or not they wanted children. ‘On the Pill,’ Rosemary commented, ‘I experienced sexuality as completely divorced from any thoughts of contraception or reproduction. The diaphragm forced me to think about contraception and therefore about whether or not I wanted a baby.’Pregnancy fears often dominate the sexuality of diaphragm user and the discovery of her lesbianism can represent a woman’s first spontaneous experience. ‘Making love with women,' Jo says, ‘undercuts that memory of my mother telling me not to get pregnant. It was a real delight to be sexual without a contraceptive, a kind of rebellion. Heterosexual sex invoke a lot of emotion about the family which can be hard to deal with. That’s one of the reasons why lesbianism has been such a sexual release for me.’The diaphragm is not 100 per cent effective as a contraceptive. Most of the women quoted here returned to it because an entirely safe, and satisfactory contraceptive hasn’t yet been invented and maybe never will be. They’ve pointed out that the diaphragm demands a sense of responsibility about your body and whether or not to have children. But restrictive abortion laws deny us that responsibility for our own bodies. If we are to use the diaphragm, and it seems many of us must, we have to have free, easily obtainable abortion on demand.
9	HEALTHIt is a basic necessity for free and independent individuals to have control over their own physical wellbeing. For women, this responsibility is increasingly usurped by medical professionals and, indirectly, political arbiters. For centuries, childbirth, contraception and abortion were part of lay health tradition, usually the concern of local community-based women. They gradually became the concern of professional medicine. Obstetrics were not included in medical training until the late nineteenth century.Contraception is now provided free on the National Health Service, abortion was made legal on limited grounds in 1967, and childbirth has moved from 85 per cent home births in 1927 to 91 per cent hospital births in 1972. The scientific and technological developments within medicine, including birth control, and the transfer of maternity care and childbirth from the home to the medical system, have been contradictory benefits for women. The medical profession treats processes like childbirth or menopause more in terms of illness than health. Women feel like passive patients who are manipulated rather than responsible people who need information and care to act positively, while reproductive health care suffers from social taboos and ignorance.The question of women’s control over their own bodies, including the right to make informed decisions and to personal knowledge about reproduction, is a political issue. The National Abortion Campaign, which was begun to defend the 1967 Act, calls for women’s right to choose for themselves. One woman who signed the petition at an N A C stall in a Bristol shopping centre said, ‘I don’t believe in women’s lib and all that, but I’m fed up with men telling us what to do. Yes, I’ll sign it’ (SR.37). Some doctors and MPs, as well as right-wing movements which continually organize to curtail the Abortion Act, hold moralistic attitudes. Ignoring the inadequacies of contraception, they view pregnancy as a punishment for illicit sex, and maternity as women’s destiny. The politics and economics of birth control have international ramifications. The injectable contraceptive, Depo-Provera, despite being banned in the United States, is still sold and issued in vast quantities in seventy, mostly Third World, countries. The morality that makes women both the victim and the cause of social problems underlies many sterilization programmes. And still no one method of existing contraception is completely reliable or safe for all women.Having formed health groups and learned how to give each other internal examinations, women are beginning to break down the power relation between doctor and patient, to bring control and knowledge of women’s bodies back to women themselves, and to learn and share information. Women’s groups have also explored alternative medicine like acupuncture, homeopathic remedies and naturopathy which don’t destroy the body’s natural defences and are concerned with the whole body and general fitness.Feminists have also investigated the blurred distinction between mental and physical illness, and the connection of both with social conditions and expectations. Both self-starvation and compulsive eating, for example, are linked with the feminine role. Rosie Parker and Sarah Mauger wrote that women who starved themselves often strived to conform, to please, to be slim, while underneath they felt inadequate and selfish. The self-starvation of anorexia nervosa was an attempt to take some form of control over their lives, a hopeless gesture of defiance and independence. Susie Orbach, in a group of women who investigated their own experience of compulsive eating, found that being far was a way of neutralizing the problems associated with feminine sexuality. There was a similar struggle between dependence and independence.Mental illness, like physical illness, is often treated with pills and technology in ways that encourage a woman’s sense of being ineffectual and a victim, rather than helping towards self-understanding and confidence. Women’s self-help therapy groups try to counter the idea that anxiety and an inability to cope are only internal and individual problems, or that to admit to needing help is a failure and a weakness. Alison Fell and Rosie Parker wrote that instead of ‘an impossible idea of self-sufficiency’, we need to ‘envisage a society where self-reliance and caring interdependence could co-exist happily. Where help could be sought and offered as just one more way, acknowledged by all, of sharing human resources’ (SR.43). 
Blood MoneyAMANDA SEBESTYENMost of us are going to menstruate 300 times in our lives. You’d never guess, though. In fact it’s one of the world’s best-kept secrets. We talk in code: it’s The Curse in middle-class boarding schools, Uncle George in the North, Red Sails in the Sunset in Australia. Everywhere, ‘women still buy sanitary towels with enormous discretion and carry their handbags to the loo when they only need to carry a napkin’ (G. Greer). No wonder one poor woman who asked her husband to bring her sanitary towels and a belt when she was in hospital ended up with a lace suspender belt and a packet of Brillo pads.The menstrual period’s no joke, though. It still means seven days’ absolute seclusion for women in Moslem, Hindu and orthodox Jewish cultures. Fear and hatred of the female body are one obvious reason why this is still happening. But there’s also a technology of menstruation which we don’t think about so often and which has just as controlling an effect on our lives. In some countries women didn’t and still don’t use anything to soak up the blood. In others they used moss and other natural fibres inside the vagina or wrapped around outside. In Ghana women wrap themselves in red rags - much more sensible than white.For centuries most European women used cloths; we still use the old words like towel and napkin, and the American expression ‘got the rags on’. Some older women can remember using these cloth towels which had to be constantly washed and reused: ‘My diapers were made of harsh towelling, and I used to creep into the laundry and crouch over a bucket of foul clouts, hoping that my brother would not catch me at my revolting labours’ (Germaine Greer again). Until quite recently women were expected to spend most of their period indoors. These towels are used today in several Third World countries, notably in China where women have to take time off work to visit wash stations and change clothes; this is sometimes given as a reason why Chinese women are still awarded fewer work points than men. Back home in Britain, though we’ve got disposable towels and tampons, periods are still supposed to make us a terrible job liability.The first disposable sanitary towel was marketed in 1880 by Southhalls but nor widely used until much later. At the turn of the century journeys still meant special equipment, because the usual napkins were so hard to change. Soluble towels came in the 1920s, they were a spin-off from the soluble bandages developed in the First World War. Tampax were first marketed in the thirties. This new technology did mean a lot more mobility for women - and that’s certainly a message the makers of sanitary protection are happy to reiterate. This is, in fact:The only promotional style of advertising to women which shows then in athletic, active and energetic roles instead of indulging the typical media woman’s bovine leer. One feminist remarked recently that in advertisements for Tampax, you get the only example of women functioning as normal active people at the time, the only time, in the month when they feel least like it. However you look at it, it is strange that at the only time of the month when women have the ultimate reinforcement of their femininity, the marketers are falling over themselves to show women how to indulge freely and fearlessly in the most ‘masculine’ of pursuits. (Rosemary Scott The Female Consumer)                        ‘That’s not the only contradiction. We’re supposed to buy freedom by acting as a captive market. Two manufacturers - Southalls and Tampax - sell 80 per cent of the sanitary protection in this country. Commercial monopolies usually mean high prices. Southalls and Tampax made nearly £3 million in 1975, the Price Commission found. Towel prices rose by up to 70 per cent between 1972 and 1975, panty because of a rise in the price of cotton. But tampon prices went up at the same time, though tampons don’t use nearly as much cotton in manufacture.Why? Well, Southalls’ tampon prices have to be linked to towel prices because the same company makes both... The Commission advised an immediate reduction in recommended retail prices - but found two years later that most small chemists’ shops had taken to charging over the recommended price instead. Competing supermarkets, on the other hand, will often cut the price of tampons sharply, but even here, the Commission pointed out, ‘our samples did not throw up any loss-leaders in sanitary protection. Even the cut-prices yield a reasonable gross margin’ i.e. profit. After all, if tuna gets too expensive customers refuse to buy. But if tampons are expensive women don’t really have much choice.The point about the manufacturers, ‘new, improved’ methods, of course, is that they often do more for sales figures than they do for our health: deodorized towels can cause allergic reactions, tampons are implicated in cervical erosion. And because the market for sanitary protection is more or less constant, the companies can only expand by trying to create new needs like minipads for between periods, and the by now notorious vaginal deodorants. The youngest age group, still hopefully ‘brand-disloyal', is of course the most sought after,        SR.64, November 1977and firms spend hugely on free samples, information leaflets and talks at schools. The latest youth product is Lillets Mini tampon for teenagers.The tampon market is, in fact, an area of fierce if limited competition between the two biggest companies - limited because with only one competitor neither can engage in a proper price war. But fierce, because the number of women using tampons is slowly rising (only by 1 per cent a year - apparently those old stories about tampons ruining you for marriage still have a hold). Tampon users tend to be younger than towel users. Lillets Mini are the latest of Southalls’ attempts to overtake Tampax, who still have some powerful advantages: they were the innovators and their brand name’s become completely identified with the product (like Biro or Hoover), and as an American company they have access to more capital for investing in sophisticated machinery and saving on labour costs. Southalls, though, invested massively in West German machinery to produce Lillets, and they’re obviously determined to get their money back. One cut-throat advertising battle has already ended in a draw: ‘Lillets are pushing their widthways expansion as opposed to the lengthways expansion of Tampax, a contract which brought the companies to commercial blows in early 1974 when both started sneering at each other’s claims and putting out knocking copy to prove it’ (Female Consumer). Eventually one slapped an injunction on the other’s advertisement.There’s another, more secret battle taking place, and it’s the period itself that’s up for grabs between the sanitary protection firms and the drug companies that market the Pill. The doctors for ‘Tampax and Dr Blacks’ say that women have always menstruated and can’t possibly stop now - besides, every one of us will spend £350 in a lifetime on sanitary protection. The drug companies’ doctors say that periods have no function except to keep women fertile - so those of us already taking the Pill could conveniently swallow seven more tablets a month and rid ourselves of ‘the Curse’ forever. But we still don’t have enough information about menstruation to make a real choice for ourselves. And as usual, these transactions are taking place behind the backs of women.But there are stirrings within the captive market. In 1975 the Free Sanitary Protection Campaign made a start at confronting the manufacturers directly. It’s a pity the campaign didn’t last because it’s an issue that affects all of us. Women in the street were really enthusiastic about Free Sanitary Protection; one woman on Social Security had three daughters, who all had their periods at the same time. The expense in that week just about wiped out their Giro payment.Women are now trying out ways of by-passing the companies’ monopoly and going back to self-help methods. Bristol Free Sanitary Protection Group ‘manufactured’ their own tampons at a street theatre and gave them to the audience. But it’s even cheaper to use something that doesn’t have to be thrown away. Some women have been using their diaphragms to collect the blood- the diaphragm holds a lot more than a towel or tampon. When you think it’s full, you remove it, wash it out and re-insert.Some women in health groups are using menstrual extraction with the Karman Cannula to get their period over in ten minutes instead of five days. Some people say it hurts, though.Now there’s another idea. Small sponges were once used for contraception.Between the wars chemists sold sponge tampons called ‘moisettes’, but they were forgotten with the arrival of disposables. Recently, though, women in the States have started using natural sponges again in place of commercial tampons. The sponges are softer, don’t irritate we vagina and can be used again and again. Sheffield women’s liberation group have been trying out the idea: ‘We find that it is more efficient, feels more natural, more comfortable and is certainly much CHEAPER.’A piece of natural sponge this size absorbs about as much as one regular tampon or towel. Sponges with small holes absorb more. To use the sponge, tie a piece of strong string or dental floss around it or through one end. Dampen it thoroughly, squeeze it out and insert. Whenever necessary, pull the string to remove it, wash with warm water and soap, squeeze out and use again. You can take a clean spare sponge with you in a bag if you can’t face washing one out in a public place. But one sponge will last you for several periods. As far as we know it doesn’t need sterilizing - towels and tampons aren’t sterile either. Just wash and keep till next month. The sponge can also be used to insert yoghurt for a thrush cure.SR.65, December 1977
‘Most of Us Had Three or Four’ AGNES MARCHANT AND HER DAUGHTER SUSAN INTERVIEWED BY ROZSIKA PARKERWhat did you do when you decided that you wanted an abortion?Agnes: In those days [1951] the problem was not knowing where to go. It wasn’t a matter of ‘Oh, all right I can go to so-and-so.’ You had to be careful who you asked. There were two abortionists in the block of flats where I lived, but I didn’t dare go to them though I knew they did it as they’d both got arrested. In fact one had got two years. When she came out she was at it again, but you couldn’t knock on her door because she’d tell everybody, ‘Guess who knocked on my door.’So you didn’t want people to know that you’d had an abortion.Agnes: Oh no. It’s only now that the law’s changed that you can talk about it, and you realize how many did have illegal abortions. People are so much freer now - they can please themselves, can’t they. In those days you felt such a hypocrite; you were leading two lives. You couldn’t tell anyone at work what was happening to you. You felt really lonely. In the end I spoke to my sister and she said she knew someone.Why did you want an abortion?Agnes: I was engaged but I didn’t want to rush into marriage. But even if I’d got married the next week, I didn’t want children.Anyway, I went to this woman with my sister. I paid her £10 and she used a syringe and soapy water. Have you ever seen one? They are sold in chemists as enema syringes. There’s a long tube with a ball in the middle and nozzle on the end where the water goes in and fills up the ball. You’ve only got to get an air bubble in and whoosh! you’re gone, aren’t you.I’ve never known anyone who had it come off first time with a syringe. I had to go back to the woman three or four times and pay her another £5 before it came off.Was it very painful?Agnes: I was working when I got symptoms. It started at seven o’clock one evening. I was haemorrhaging and losing blood clots. Then twenty-four hours later the thing came away. It was the first abortion I’d had and I thought, ‘Well, that wasn’t too bad.’ But I had pretty awful pain, mind.Did you think of going to a doctor when the pain got bad?Agnes: Oh no, oh no. They’d send you straight into hospital where they would try and save it - prop your legs up and give you a few injections. I never went into hospital but I knew people who did and they were given a really tough time by the law. The police would stand by your bed and keep on at you, ‘Who did it? Tell us who did it and we’ll get your money back for you.’Did they ever charge the woman who had had the abortion?Agnes: They’d never have got a conviction.What was the average sentence passed on an abortionist?Agnes: It varied from eighteen months to five years. It depended on what the charge was or if a woman had had previous convictions.You had a second abortion?Agnes: Yes, the next time I got pregnant my daughter Susan was five and I was divorced and I thought, ‘Oh God, I can’t...’ I was pretty desperate. I was on my own and I knew I couldn’t possibly manage another. Anyway, this was in 1958, when I had a young doctor who was quite good. He gave me some tablets and said, ‘If you’re not pregnant this will bring on your period.’ I took them. Nothing happened. I went back and he said, ‘Well, it’s obvious that you are pregnant. There’s nothing I can do, but there are one or two people around...’He mentioned somebody’s name. I’d heard of this particular woman and thought that she was wary who she entertained because she’d been arrested a few times. And I’d heard she used knitting needles. ‘No, she doesn’t,’ the doctor said, ‘that’s just gossip. She uses a syringe and she’s quite good. Once it happens, once it comes off, you can call me in and I’ll come. I don’t mind cleaning up, you know.’You went to the woman he suggested?Agnes: Yes. No one knew I was going. If anything had gone wrong she could have just dumped me and nobody would have known. She was - God, she must have been about seventy years old. She had all these Catholic pictures on the walls; big old-fashioned pictures of Our Lord with the lamb and the crook, pictures of the Lady of Lourdes, and rosaries and palm crosses draped everywhere.She said, ‘Well, it’s expensive dear.’ So I said, ‘Look, all I’ve got is £30.’ ‘All right,’ she said, ‘I’ll do it.’ Later I discovered that she did it for other people for £5.Her house was none too clean and a bit musty smelling. You sat in a funny, dirty-looking armchair and put your leg over the arm so that she could get into your vagina with the syringe.Afterwards I waited twelve hours (it comes off within twelve to twenty-four hours after being syringed) but nothing happened. Altogether I went back to her about seven times.How pregnant were you?Agnes: Oh, I ended up about three and a half months pregnant. I knew she wasn’t really trying so I finally said, ‘Look, if you can possibly try and do it I’ll see you all right again. I haven’t got any money but I’ll get some by the end of the week.’ Then, as I walked home, so this soapy water started to come away from me. This had never happened before so I thought, well, at least it’s penetrated the womb. Before it had just acted like a douche.Anyway, the next day I woke up with a slight show. I went to work and started to feel a bit queasy. I came home and it came off that night. I didn’t have as much pain with that one as I did with the one when I was six and a half weeks pregnant, funnily enough. I had pain for only about two or three hours before the thing came away. Then I thought, well I’ll go to bed, but I was frightened to lie down because I felt I’d die if I did. So I propped myself up all night and with the slightest movement of my body I felt all this blood coming away from me. It was, you know, quite frightening.The next morning, feeling a bit lightheaded, I went to the doctor and he gave me a vitamin shot and some medicine.Did the woman you went to earn her living by giving abortions?Agnes: Yes, she used to go out to people - mostly to the West End where girls had plenty of money. This particular old lady, she told me - but whether it was boastful bragging I don’t know - she said that she’d been to Belgium and Switzerland to perform abortions. She made a small fortune during the war performing abortions for Americans. She got arrested, thanks to a girl who had it done and had just got to the top of the street when the police picked her up. ‘Come on,’ they said, ‘just take us back and show us the house you went into and we’ll get your money back.’ She got eighteen months. The local police knew what was going on and she was left alone for quite a while. If she’d stuck to her rich clients she would have been OK - she used to go to their flats. But when she started raking in anyone who knocked on her door...Were there women you knew who gave themselves abortions?Agnes: One or two girls I knew said they had done it themselves, but those particular girls couldn’t even insert a Tampax.Did your friends’ husbands disapprove of their wives having abortions?Agnes: They didn’t like it. Usually they didn’t know. So while you are going through the process of the thing coming away and you had pains in your tummy.’ you had to put on a good front and pretend you were OK.I suppose many women had children simply because they were scared of having an illegal abortion?Agnes: Oh yes, no end, because it was frightening. They [the abortionists] didn’t tell you what was going to happen. They’d syringe the woman, she would go off, come back if nothing happened, go off again and if she didn’t come back the abortionist would think that she was (a) dead, or (b) O K. They never bothered to explain about the afterbirth or anything. Imagine someone home on their own with all that going on.Were you worried about the notion that abortion was taking a life?Agnes: Quite honestly, we never even thought about it, it never crossed our minds that we might be taking a human life. Up to a few years ago nobody thought about that - I didn’t and I’m sure none of my friends did. It was just a thing there that they didn’t want. Anyway I don’t think it is taking a human life - people are only bringing this forward now.Another thing they are trotting forward is the psychological damage caused by abortion. Well, you might get one or two neurotic girls but if abortion really did cause psychological damage, we - my generation - would all be in the nut-house because we didn’t have just one or two, most of us had three or four. Today, with better contraception, girls usually have just one and it’s all laid on the line for them, they go in, they go out and it’s all done for them. We had to go around looking for somebody and there was all the aggravation of going backwards and forwards, and the worry...Yes, if it did upset you psychologically all my generation would be raving lunatics.Susan: What frightens me about these people who are trying to make abortion illegal is the thought of having to go through what my mum went through. I think every child should be a wanted child. I wasn’t wanted and my mum had an awful struggle money-wise.Agnes: Yes, but I was in love with your father - still am. If I was going to have a kid I’d want his.Susan: But you must admit it was inconvenient.Agnes: Oh, goodness me, yes. I tried for a couple of months to get rid of Susan until the woman I went to said, ‘No, I can’t...’ But once I’d made up my mind that I couldn’t get rid of her, I got on with it. I’m glad I did, of the three I’d have preferred to have her. The others were probably boys - they always say boys come away easier than girls.Susan: It’s understandable. In her situation I’d go for a legal abortion now.Agnes: When Susan was younger, I used to say to her, ‘Look, if ever you get pregnant, don’t go and tell your friend’s mum or aunt - come to me. Don’t go off and buy this and take that when you don’t know what’s in it.’ I knew of cases where people died through taking things.Taking what things?Agnes: There were little chemists that sold you pills and things. You’d tell the chemist that you were overdue and he’d say, ‘Oh dear, one minute, see if this will help you,’ and he’d sell you this pill. You couldn’t just go to any chemist, but you’d hear word o’ mouth who would help you out. There was one quite near where we lived and my sister bought a tiny pill for half a crown from him in 1953. She took the pill and had this terrific haemorrhage for about two or three days – the toilet was absolutely filled up with blood. Then that packed up and she thought she had miscarried. A fortnight later the haemorrhage started again for three or four days, but she was still pregnant and had the baby after all.Then there was a friend of mine who took quinine. She drank the stuff by the bottle and today she is almost blind. It didn’t help - she had to go and have an abortion afterwards.Susan: It was all so unnecessary. The men don’t understand. They think that if abortion laws are tightened that the problem is going to disappear- that women aren’t going to get pregnant. But the problem was always there- people just died quietly in a corner and nobody ever knew it was for an abortion.Agnes: Yes, they went off and died and nobody mentioned it, or the family would say, ‘She died of peritonitis.’ So, if it’s made illegal again...Susan: Or even if it’s tightened up...Agnes: If it’s tightened up it’s going to give all those crooks scope again. You’re going to have all the backstreet abortionists in business again, aren’t you.Susan: Yes, I used to live in a fiat over the back of Brixton and my next-door neighbour had girls trooping up, mostly on Sunday afternoons. Nothing was said, but people like her are warning for trade to pick up if the law goes backwards.SR.50, September 1976
Visit to an Italian Health CentreMARIE ARNOLDI arrived in the street I’d been directed to after a long hot tram ride through the city. The woman who had told me the way didn’t remember the number. She said I’d know the consultorio when I saw it. This was an old working-class district with blocks of fiats and lots of women and kids on the streets.The first likely building looked a bit official, like a Social Security office, but it said clinic on the door, so I asked the two women at the desk if this was the consultorio. They looked at my orange N A C badge which said ‘National Abortion Campaign - A Woman’s Right to Choose’ and asked what it was. When I explained, in my broken Italian, they were all smiles and warmth. ‘Ah, you want the consulcorio... It’s not here, it’s a bit further down the road. You can’t miss it.’The real consultorio was two tiny rooms with a few notices in the window - ‘Women’s Clinic’, ‘All Women Welcome’.The place was crowded that afternoon. Luckily the woman I’d arranged to meet spoke good English. Immediately everyone wanted to know who I was, what my badge was for, how our campaign for free abortion was going.They showed me their kids, put their arms round me, and pointed out their flats through the window. This was their place. A place for women to come. For most of them it was the only place where they could be together and discuss their problems, husbands, kids with other women.After a while, I sat down with the woman I had arranged to meet and she told me how the consultorio had been set up...Two years ago, several women and women’s groups in Turin got together to decide the best way to organize with women. Some were members of left groups, the rest weren’t.After long discussions, some of them decided to set up a women’s health centre.The health system is very poor in Italy. Contraception is expensive and hard to get; abortion is still illegal and in many cases people are forced to pay for their own medicines in full.The group picked an area with few facilities, old housing and a fairly stable community. They started with a general agreement that they weren’t establishing a ‘service to the community’ - they were fighting women’s oppression particularly through struggling for women to be able to control their own bodies.They had four main principles:1. To give away contraceptives free and make contraceptive advice central.2. To try to break down the relationship between doctor and patient.3· To try to establish a firm relationship with women in the area. 4· Not to do abortions (because it was illegal).In the months after the consultorio opened in January 1975 the last two ideas had to be rethought.The first to use the centre were feminists from all over Turin, wanting contraceptives and advice. (The consultorio still manages to get free supplies from different firms, though they don’t know how long this will last.) After six months, the collective called a halt. They said it was a local centre, but local women were being kept away by all these others. Why didn’t they set up consultori in other areas? (Since then four have started in Turin alone.)But after this, local women still didn’t come, even when all the flats, houses and shops had been leafleted. Quite soon they realized why - local women thought they were do-gooders, but useless because they didn’t do abortions.It’s been so hard to get contraception in Italy that women have relied on backstreet abortion. Three million illegal abortions per year is not an exaggeration. The collective soon realized that it was common for local women to have had three or four.Eventually they decided they had to do abortions too. They contracted a midwife who had learned to use the Karman method (where a small tube is inserted into the neck of the womb and the contents sucked out by an aspirator). They explained how the consultorio worked, and she agreed to work with them and keep her prices low. They are also learning to do abortions themselves.A few days later a woman well-known and - liked locally had an abortion there with the new method. Within a week, the whole neighbourhood had got the word.A collective of about twenty women runs the consultorio. They open up in the mornings, run the sessions, keep the files and have weekly meetings. Two women doctors are part of this collective. (There is also one male doctor, the only man allowed in.)When someone comes for advice, she is asked to come to the afternoon collective discussion.This is a first attempt to get women to identify their problems as women together. It is often difficult as few have ever spoken out about their personal and sexual lives. The collective try to draw the new women out. The discussion may be about thing in the news like a rape or a demonstration for abortion - or someone may want to ask the doctor for explanations and advice.The woman I spoke to said this was often difficult: ‘When the doctor puts on his white coat, he takes on a lot of authority. The women have respect for him. We have to constantly challenge this. And in many cases, we know more than him now. We’re so used to hearing about problems like “Will the Pill affect my liver?” But also we have to learn more ourselves. Some of us are taking courses in health so that we can do examinations too.’After this first talk, the group usually breaks up into twos or threes. With the women who need internal examination, the consultorio tries to avoid individual counselling. They ask one of the younger women, who is likely to be less inhibited about her body, if she objects to other women being present during her examination.If she says it’s OK, three or four women will be asked if they’d like to be present in preparation for their own ‘internals’. ‘We don’t ask everyone, because some would simply be frightened away. We realize that for some women it takes a long time to get used to the idea of even looking at your body.’So nearly every woman learns in a very practical and social way how a woman’s body works. When the time comes for her to have an ‘internal’ (possibly the first she’s ever had) it’s less traumatic because she knows what to expect. And more important, she understands what is happening.Most of the women didn’t previously know much about their bodies. There is a constant emphasis on diagrams, charts and informal chats.Many of the women then set up their own discussion groups, using the consultorio as a place to meet. And they’re all asked to come back. Without this, it could easily become just a referral service with no continuity.Other women who had taught themselves to do abortions told me later that they didn’t want to run around town with their little black bags, seeing individual women in their kitchens, then disappearing. They wanted a group or a centre to refer to, so that for any woman an abortion would just be the beginning of an involvement with other women. An involvement which could lead to women’s power growing collectively and consciously.I asked about the problems of illegality. They said so far there have been no raids from the police. For security, medical files are hidden elsewhere. But they felt that their strongest defence is that the police wouldn’t dare disrupt something which has such strong support and involvement from so many local women.[‘Marie Arnold’ was a pseudonym for Kate Truscott.

New Zealand Clinic BombedNEW SHORTThe Sisters Overseas Service (S O S) in Auckland, New Zealand, is a feminist agency which has helped over five hundred women get abortions in Australia since the New Zealand government passed its extremely restrictive abortion law which even forbids abortion in the case of rape. As well as providing counselling and referrals to sympathetic doctors, S O S accompanies women to the airport, helps them borrow money and provides them with a detailed description of what the abortion will be like and what symptoms to expect afterwards.This Easter, S O S was burned to a shell - exactly two years after a similar fire destroyed the clinic in Epsom, N Z, which was then performing legal terminations.... The situation in New Zealand has been described by one doctor as ‘a tragic shambles which has exceeded our worst fears’. Of the four hospitals in Auckland licensed to carry out abortions, two have no operating surgeons, the third is a private hospital with facilities available only to doctors who regularly operate there, and the fourth has a few doctors willing to perform abortions.Pressure is building up for a liberalization of the law, but a father of eleven is heading a ‘Right to Life’ party which intends to put up forty anti-abortion candidates in the general election this year.SR.75, October 1978
Clinic Bombed, Cleveland, USANEWSHORTAn abortion clinic in Cleveland, U S A, was firebombed by antiabortionists on 18 February while a woman was inside having an abortion. Luckily no one was seriously hurt. The ‘Right to Life Society’ of Greater Cleveland claimed that the bomber must have been a man who was angry because his daughter or wife had chosen not to have a child without asking him.This isn’t the first time health clinics providing abortions have been bombed or burnt in the States - six have been attacked in the last year, and others systematically harassed by anti-abortionist pickets, occupations and even threats on the lives of workers’ children. In October picketers of a clinic in North Carolina were acquitted of trespass because the judges believed they had ‘a good-faith belief that their actions were necessary to save lives’. But how long will it be before the antiabortionists manage to burn someone alive in the name of the ‘Right to Live’?S R.70, May 1978       Christine Roche, SR.39, September 1975
Puerto Rico: 35 Per Cent of Women of Childbearing Age SterilizedLYNN DI PIETROPuerto Rico in 1975 is an island devoted to tourism, capital-intensive industry, US exploitation of natural resources. 26 per cent of the arable land is occupied by US military bases. The US has succeeded in forcing 40 per cent of the population to migrate to US slums, and has sterilized 35 per cent of the women of childbearing age.This figure represents the highest incidence of female sterilization in the world. India and Pakistan, which have public sterilization programmes, have 5 per cent and 3 per cent respectively. A 1968 study showed that of all the women sterilized in Puerto Rico two thirds were sterilized between the ages of twenty and twenty-nine years, the average age being twenty-six.A secret document from an economic policy group commissioned in November 1973 by the Governor of Puerto Rico, entitled Opportunities for Employment, Education and Training, sees Puerto Rico’s key problem as unemployment. The members of the committee have devised two solutions: one to foster new jobs, and the other to ‘reduce the working sector of the population’. The fact that 35 per cent of the women have been sterilized indicates that they have opted for the latter.The sterilization programme is to be carried out by a network of government agencies: Social Service, Health, Housing. The above mentioned document sees the potential clientele as all the women of childbearing age not yet sterilized. There are no restrictions as to age, number of children, or marital status.The sterilization programme in Puerto Rico is a forced one. This does not mean that women are being dragged off the streets and forced to submit to sterilization.The pressure is much more subtle, and suitably disguised in the rhetoric of health of mother and child: what used to be the Family Planning has now been incorporated into the more comprehensive ‘Programme of Mothers and Children’, according to the secret document quoted above. ‘The programme of mothers and children of the Department of Health is the natural means of attracting the possible clientele. 78 per cent of mothers give birth in hospitals, and 68 per cent in public hospitals.’In many cases women are approached about sterilization immediately after giving birth, and while still in a weakened state. In other case they are made to sign documents, often in English - a language which they are unlikely to read - before operations or deliveries, giving the doctor authority to do whatever he or she sees as necessary for their ‘physical wellbeing’.With families receiving state welfare benefits (59.6 per cent of the Puerto Rican population live below the US government poverty level), pressure is brought to bear by the various government agencies on whom they are dependent. Forced into a situation in which they are dependent on local government for a subsistence existence, they are particularly vulnerable. Many accept sterilization without being fully conscious of what they are agreeing to and often after being given the impression that the operation is reversible. Sterilization advice is part of the follow-up to all hospital deliveries.Thus the very families that are forced into poverty because of a misdirected and profit-oriented economic system are asked to pay a further price by submitting their bodies to government dictates. There is no significant difference in the number of wives of middle- and working-class men who have been sterilized, but the middle-class woman might take the decision to be sterilized because she wants to pursue some endeavour other than childraising, and she has the education and ability to do so. It is the working-class woman, often made to see childbearing as her only contribution to society, who is under pressure to submit.It is no accident either that sterilization is the preferred and encouraged method of birth control. It is not a case of a woman’s right to choose: if this were the case other methods would be encouraged. Only sterilization serves the intended purpose of the whole exercise - depopulation.It is interesting to note that safe abortions are virtually unobtainable in Puerto Rico, despite a U S Supreme Court ruling in January 1973 confirming their legality. In practice abortions are only available in private hospitals, and then at a price of $250 (£110) and up.Compare this figure with a report in the New York Times of November 1974 that nineteen free sterilization clinics have been opened in the San Juan metropolitan area. The clinics have been in operation at a top capacity programme of about 1,000 sterilizations a month.The object is not to condemn sterilization per se but rather to illustrate that sterilization can only be realistically analysed within a social framework.As women we must take special notice of the sterilization programme in Puerto Rico, as it is indicative of a situation in which a government whose decisions are taken mainly by men has taken upon itself to control our bodies by determining for us when we should not reproduce. While traditionally our ability to have children has been used to create myths about our inferiority in other endeavours, it is enlightening to see that when that ability is economically counterproductive it loses all mystique and becomes a ‘function’ which must be disposed of.The US government and the colonial government of Puerto Rico claim that the sterilization programme is meant to be socially beneficial: that it is an attempt to raise the general standard of living and reduce the unemployment rate, estimated at 30 per cent by the Puerto Rican Chamber of Commerce. However, a brief analysis of the colonial economy of Puerto Rico demonstrates that the social and economic problems of Puerto Rico are not the result of overpopulation, but rather a distortion of the Puerto Rican economy by virtue of its colonial relationship with the US.Since it acquired Puerto Rico at the end of the Spanish American war in 1898 - an aggressive war waged against Spain in the early day of US imperialism - the US government has controlled the economy of Puerto Rico and developed it according to its own needs and not the needs of the island’s people.Before it became a US colony, the economy of Puerto Rico was an agricultural one in which the country produced coffee, tobacco, and sugar. The first thing the US did was to allow the coffee and tobacco cultivation to decline, and concentrated all investment on sugar - that product which the US needed but did not itself produce.So from the beginning the Puerto Rican economy took a step backwards, the multiculture agriculture was replaced by a monocultural one. A sugar-plantation economy soon emerged, run by giant members of US sugar monopolies. This economy thrived on abundant source of cheap labour, and so birth control was not needed.In the early 1940s the US turned to Cuba, Hawaii and the Dominican Republic for their abundant sugar crop, because of their even cheaper sources of labour. Higher profits could be made elsewhere.In an attempt to solve the economic problem which it had created, the US government initiated a programme called Operation Bootstrap, designed to create jobs for the Puerto Rican people. Operation Bootstrap coincided with the postwar economic boom when the United States had to supply a war-ravaged Europe with manufactured good.Companies were encouraged to relocate in Puerto Rico, the benefits being a source of relatively cheap labour; an up to seventeen-year tax exemption, plus low overhead, expenditures in transport, and a ready supply of cheap energy.With its agriculture devastated by lack of investment, large masse of Puerto Ricans had migrated to the cities to seek work. Operation Bootstrap failed. When tax exemptions ran out, and Europe recovered from the war, and when it became obvious that a cheaper labour force could be exploited in Asia, US companies pulled out of Puerto Rico. Again, higher profit could be made elsewhere.The United States was unable to provide an economic solution to Puerto Rico’s problems of poverty and unemployment and still reap super profits, the key to all US involvement in the island. The real answer to Puerto Rico’s economic, and hence social problems would of course challenge the colonial nature of its economy, and its total dependence on the US. The US had to avoid recognizing the real cause of the crisis, and yet still prevent the potential upheaval from the socially explosive unemployed.The all-purpose answer was, and is, depopulation. It was during Operation Bootstrap that masses of Puerto Ricans were forced to migrate to the US slums. It was during this period, too, that the quiet beginnings of the sterilization programme were set up.By 1950, 16.5 per cent of women over twenty had been sterilized. By 1965 the figure had reached 34 per cent. Again there is an economic explanation for the drastic increase. As Operation Bootstrap was on the way out, highly mechanized, capital-intensive industry was on the way in.Providing jobs is no longer a consideration. A third period of US exploitation has begun. Huge multinational petrochemical and pharmaceutical plants have spread over the island. These industries are noxious and polluting and to avoid outcries by US environmentalists they are located in Puerto Rico.While they provide relatively little employment for the people, they destroy the very basis of their existence - land, water and air. Rich mineral resources were discovered in Puerto Rico in the early 1960s by Kennicott Copper and American Metal Climax. Again, these industries are destroying huge tracts of land in the process, and providing few jobs.Major oil interests are eager to build a superport for the refining of petroleum on the island. This superport has been refused by several major cities in the US because of pollution and the danger of oil spills.So the picture becomes clear. US economic plans for Puerto Rico presuppose depopulation. People are counterproductive to US interests.All humanitarian rhetoric aside, the sterilization programme does not benefit Puerto Rican women. It does not benefit the Puerto Rican people. It benefits multinational companies. It is a genocidal programme aimed at the destruction of the Puerto Rican nation through the malicious manipulation of women by depriving them of their right to control their own bodies.SR.39, September 1975 
Breakthrough in Male ContraceptionA JOKE       DAWN BRACEYThe newest development in male contraception was unveiled recently at the American Women’s Surgical Symposium held at the Ann Arbor Medical Centre. Dr Sophie Merkin, of the Merkin Clinic, announced the preliminary findings of a study conducted on 763 unsuspecting male undergraduate students at a large midwest university. In her report, Dr Merkin stated that the new contraceptive - the I P D- was a breakthrough in male contraception. It will be marketed under the trade-name ‘Umbrelly’. The I P D (intrapenile device) resembles a tiny folded umbrella which is inserted through the head of the penis and pushed into the scrotum with a plunger-like instrument. Occasionally there is perforation of the scrotum but this is disregarded since it is known that the male has few nerve endings in this area of his body. The underside of the umbrella contains a spermicidal jelly, hence the name ‘Umbrelly’. Experiments on 1,000 white whales from the continental shelf (whose sexual apparatus is said to be the closest to man’s) proved the Umbrelly to be 100 per cent effective in preventing production of sperm, and eminently satisfactory to the female whale since it does not interfere with her rutting pleasure.Dr Merkin declared the Umbrelly to be statistically safe for the human male. She reported that of the 763 graduate students tested with the device only two died of scrotal infection, only twenty experienced swelling to the tissues. Three developed cancer of the testicles, and thirteen were too depressed to have an erection. She stated that common complaints ranged from cramping and bleeding to acute abdominal pain. She emphasized that these symptoms were merely indications that the man’s body had not yet adjusted to the device. Hopefully the symptoms would disappear within a year.One complication caused by the I P D and briefly mentioned by Dr Merkin was the incidence of massive scrotal infection necessitating the surgical removal of the testicides. ‘But this is a rare case,’ said Merkin, ‘too rare to be statistically important.’ She and other distinguished members of the Women’s College of Surgeons agreed that the benefits far outweighed the risk to any individual man.SR.93, April 1980
Radical MidwivesJENNY SPIKKSThe word ‘midwife’ comes from the Anglo-Saxon ‘with woman’. There have always been women who have attended other women in childbirth, and down the ages these women have been under attack. At times they were classed as witches and put to death. Attempts have been made consistently by men in powerful positions, such as priest or medicine man, to destroy the midwife, and take control of the birth process - an essentially female process.In 1902 the Central Midwives Board (CMB) was set up as a statutory body to supervise the training and practice of midwifery. This board was not run by midwives, but greatly dominated by obstetricians. However, midwifery was recognized as a profession. Once trained and put on the toll of midwives, a midwife became respectable and was a skilled practitioner in her own right.Meanwhile medical science has become more technical. The whole process of labour and delivery can now be initiated, controlled and completed by doctors and their technology. Control over bodily processes is often substituted for understanding of those processes. Admittedly, many medical advances in obstetrics have helped detect and alleviate problems as they arise. But these successes do not warrant indiscriminate use of medical technology in maternity care. In fact technical interference in the normal physiological process may well carry more risks than advantages to the mother and baby.The use of a hormone drip to ‘accelerate’ labour puts the woman at risk of constant strong contractions, which could lead to rupture of the uterus and to the death of the baby due to oxygen deprivation. Monitoring equipment attached to the mother and unborn baby, often used to prevent the risks of accelerated labour occurring, can itself disturb the labour by stopping the mother from making herself comfortable in the position that suits her, and so increasing her need for pain-relieving drugs, which carry their own risks to mother and baby.These trends inevitably mean the phasing out of basic midwifery skills, such as helping women to cope with the pain of labour, feeling the strength and frequency of contractions, listening to the baby’s heart beat, knowing when normal is becoming abnormal. As these skills are phased out, so is the midwife. Instead the teaching hospital are breeding obstetric nurses to be handmaidens to the obstetricians and their technology.This means that the choices open to women having babies are becoming narrower and narrower; choices as to where she gives birth, how she gives birth, who is with her, how and when she feeds her baby.A small group of women, some midwives, others training or about to start training, got together early in 1976 to share their discontent and frustration and their hopes. A few came from the Stares and Canada, where midwifery was virtually stamped out years ago, though the legal position varies from state to state. In order to learn the skills they had to come to Britain. They were shocked to find that here too midwifery was dying a slow death and that maternity care was becoming very similar to the dehumanized treatment the other side of the Atlantic. Gradually the group grew by word of mouth and we began to meet every six weeks in different parts of the country. At first our weekends were filled with ‘horror stories’ (as we call them). But we’d be relieved to see each other and know we were with people who felt the same. For a weekend we were no longer isolated; we could shout and scream and laugh and bawl about our situations.Midwives are employed by the Area Health Authorities and paid by the N H S. They are trained in schools of midwifery attached to maternity units, in the same way that nurses are trained, but with a period of time working on the district with a district midwife.Once qualified you can be a district or a hospital midwife, though generally you are required to gain some hospital experience before going on the district. District midwives are given the rank of ‘sister’. In hospital you are not made a ‘sister’ until you have gained some experience as a ‘staff midwife’. A midwife who has just been made a ‘sister’, either on the district or in hospital, is paid £2,706 plus an extra £312 a year and a yearly supplement of 5 per cent.In 1976-7 there were 21,000 midwives who notified the CMB of their intention to practise. (Every midwife has to do this at the beginning of each year.) They may be practising full- or part-time. In 1975 there were 3,600 full-time district midwives.Midwives work with women through pregnancy, labour and for twenty-eight days following the birth. If it were possible for midwives to follow the same woman right through the process, midwives would get more job satisfaction and, we think, women would have far better care.However, as a hospital midwife, you work in either ante-natal, delivery or post-natal; you very rarely see one woman through all three. As a district midwife, you may give some ante-natal care with a G P if s/he holds an ante-natal clinic. You may be lucky enough to do one or two home deliveries or do some deliveries at a GP unit or even in a consultant unit. But most of your work is post-natal care, visiting women who have come home from hospital. These visits are required by law to be done daily for ten days after delivery and then up to twenty-eight days if this is felt necessary by midwife and mother.Post-natal work can be very rewarding but, on its own, not as satisfying as giving continual care. The district midwife was once described as someone who is invited to a party just to do the washing up! District and hospital midwifery is supposed to be being ‘integrated’. This seems to mean that district in midwives are being assimilated by the hospitals. Hospital midwives are hardly ever known to do any work on the district. Within the hospital there is a career structure with different rates of pay through which a midwife can rise, ending in teaching and administration. We are critical of the fact that beyond a certain point you can climb no further up the ladder without ceasing to practise midwifery.For those of us who were direct entry student midwives - i.e. with no previous nurse training - to come into midwifery was like going back to school. On the very first day, you put on your uniform and are called nurse so and so. Immediately your identity is taken away and you assume a submissive role in the hierarchy.The course, which lasts two years for direct entry students, one for S R Ns and one and a half years for S E Ns (though it’s about to be lengthened), is organized so that you spend a very short time on each ward. So by the time you have adjusted to the ward staff and their particular routine and are beginning to feel confident in what you are supposed to be doing, you are whisked off somewhere else, just as you feel ready to start making constructive criticism or allowing your personal feelings and views to be known.But obviously the main barrier against self-expression is the constant threat of not getting qualified - we need that qualification to be able to practise legally.Those of us who already had nurse training were used to the hierarchy. We’d learned to fear the consequences of standing up for ourselves. But training as midwives, many of us thought, we would acquire a skill of which we were ‘practitioners in our own right’, not just helping out doctors. It was soon apparent that we were not going to be taught how to take responsibility and make decisions for ourselves, or how to treat our ‘patients’ as healthy women, not as sick people totally dependent on us.Student midwives are deliberately deprived of knowledge and power. They are frequently refused entry to medical students’ lectures and even to hospital libraries. One student midwife wished to report a midwife who had treated a woman violently during labour. The midwife had in fact had nine previous complaint against her - this one would have brought about her dismissal. But when the student reported it to the nursing officer above her she was not informed that for her complaint to be acknowledged he had to hand in a written report within seven days. So no action was taken and the student was herself ostracized by the rest of the midwifery staff.Having gained a midwifery qualification, we are kept very much in the confines of N H S bureaucracy. It is difficult to get jobs on the district. In hospitals we are immediately given administrative tasks on the wards and have little time to practise our new skills and little consistent contact with childbearing women. In ante-natal clinics we are given the joyful job of chaperoning the obstetricians - rushing women in and out of cubicles and taking their blood pressure. The rest is left to the obstetrician, even in many cases where there are no abnormalities in the pregnancy.So care is fragmented and the midwife’s fragment is seen by all concerned as insignificant. The midwife’s confidence in her own skills is undermined. The mother is made to feel she is merely an appendage to her uterus, which is proceeding through the hospital on a conveyor belt. If on the other hand midwives could take total responsibility for more women, the doctor would have more time to see any women with complications.For the more experienced midwife, the labour ward is a humiliating place where she must take orders from inexperienced house doctors. If district midwives are invited into hospital to do a delivery, they are usually interfered with so that now many refuse to take on hospital deliveries.One district midwife attending a woman in hospital left her for half an hour while she went for lunch. She was quite satisfied with the woman’s condition. When she returned, ‘someone’ had decided that the labour was taking too long (the woman herself had not complained) and had set up a hormone drip to ‘accelerate’ labour. So the midwife was no longer attending a normal labour: she was now nursing a high-risk patient, and all without any consultation or respect for her own judgement. This is ironic as labouring women in the care of the hospital obstetric services are much more likely to be left alone than those in the care of the district midwife.It is upsetting and exhausting to have to stand powerlessly and see women deprived of the information and choice that are their right. In the labour ward, it sometimes becomes difficult for the midwife herself to remember that this woman is experiencing something unique in her life and that she has a life and home, family and friends. Too often childbirth becomes a routine procedure, monitored on graphs, unrelated to the world outside. On the post-natal ward everything is still beyond the woman’s control. One wanted to feed her baby during the night, but in that particular hospital it was not policy for women to feed their babies on the first night after they were born - they should be asleep. She was told by the auxiliary nurse (evidently in fear and trembling of her superiors) that she couldn’t because it would ‘upset sister’. Who was most upset we wonder?Women who can’t stand being in hospital any longer find it hard to discharge themselves. Dire warnings are usually given about the possible consequences to the baby and the guilt the mother would feel for the rest of her life. This, despite the safe and adequate care available from the district midwifery service and local GP.Once home and in the care of the district midwife, it becomes clear what sort of ignorance women are kept in. One woman was so thankful that she’d had her baby in hospital; otherwise, she thought, she might have died. I n fact it turns out she might have died because she was in hospital under the care of the doctors.She had had a Caesarean section with her first baby. They induced labour for her second pregnancy. (That is risky in itself because hormone-induced contractions can be very strong indeed and so be dangerous to the scar on her uterus from the Caesarean section. They also gave her epidural anaesthesia. (This meant that she could feel nothing at all from the waist down, and so would not be able to inform the staff if she felt anything going wrong.)Anyway, they began to think that something was up and took her to theatre. As they cut through her skin and muscle layer, they saw the uterus rupturing along the scar line and were just able to save the baby and the woman. And this woman was grateful to the doctors and the hospital. They had blinded her with science and covered up their complete blunder and mismanagement of her labour.Gradually we became frustrated with hearing over and over again the horrors of maternity care. We wanted to decide what to do about it. Previously we had described ourselves as a study and support group, but now we had business matters that required time for decision making.We finally decided to call ourselves the Association of Radical Midwives. (The initials ARM in obstetric terminology stand for artificial rupture of membranes - with obvious implications for getting things moving and stirring them up.) In January 1977 we structured our six weekly meetings to which about twenty people come. Friday evenings (and every opportunity between sessions) are for reunions and ‘horror stories’. Saturday is a day of study, when we share practical skills and open discussions on different topics. Sometimes we have outside speakers. We have covered such subjects as breastfeeding, psychoprophylaxis, active management of labour, the use of ultra sound, infant awareness and blood taking. Sunday, our business day, has become more and more hectic.Early on we discussed the directions we could go in. Did we want to set up an alternative birth centre? Or were we going to be a more general pressure group? Or could we take on both? The birth centre project seems to have been shelved for the moment. Our main problems were how to fund it and how to be alternative and yet within the National Health Service.In the summer of 1977 an article about us appeared in the Sunday Times. The response was quite overwhelming. We were certainly not prepared for dealing with over a hundred inquiries. At our next meeting after that article was published, we had to set out the nitty-gritty of our aims and how we were going to organize. We decided: we aim to restore the role of the midwife for the benefit of childbearing women and their babies.Our objectives are:To re-establish the confidence of the midwife in her own skills.To share ideas, skills and information.To encourage midwives in their support of a woman’s active participation in birth.To reaffirm the need for midwives to provide continuity of care. To explore alternative patterns of care.To encourage evaluation of developments in our field.The group felt we should avoid any hierarchical structure or elite executive. We wanted our organization to be on womanly lines and not to fall into the pitfalls of male-dominated organizations, such as unions or churches, that are bogged down with bureaucracy and power at the top. We decided that as an organization of midwives for midwives we did not need full-time employees. We would rather work slowly, but with the support of the whole group, than quickly and ‘efficiently’ without grass roots participation.So we set up autonomous regional groups and decided to maintain our six weekly meetings as the national policy-decision-making body. We hoped to have an annual national conference which would be a general meeting place and platform for ideas, but not responsible for making decisions. Meanwhile it was still necessary to have a secretary, treasurer and publicity co-ordinator. These three are answerable to the whole group and if problems come up between meetings, they can consult with the regional group contacts.Recently we have been struggling to define our political position. People question our label ‘radical’. The Central Midwives Board (the statutory body responsible for midwifery) felt unable to send a representative to our recent conference on 'Midwives and the Law’, not wanting to be ‘partisan’. The Royal College of Midwives (the midwives’ professional association) has some other excuse. It was apparent that without us outlining our position, or even consciously having a position, the establishment had decided what our relationship to it was.There were fears that we might be alienating whole group of midwives and missing important opportunities if we were to stand outside or against the Royal College of Midwives. Nonetheless, general consensus was that we are ‘radical’ in that we are a grass roots organization, wanting to restore the roots of midwifery, and that we are ‘feminist’ in that we are doing this for all women to have the right of control over their bodies in pregnancy, labour and the post-natal period. We also feel we are more likely to gain support through involvement in the trade unions (in our case, N U P E or C O H S E) than in the Royal College of Midwives.It seems that we have taken on quite a struggle and that to restore the role of the midwife is a hard task. Jobs for midwives are becoming fewer, especially on the district, where they do have a certain amount of autonomy. Many Area Health Authorities have definite policies to phase out the district midwife.As the national policy is towards 100 per cent hospital confinements (despite reassuring noises from Ennals)	the district midwife is not needed for delivery. Also much of the ante-natal care is being undertaken in hospital. The post-natal care, it is argued by administrator and some health workers, could be shared by district nurse midwife and health visitors.We must fight this trend. Childbearing women need the continuity of care that district midwives can give. Direct entry training for student midwives (starting to train as a midwife without previous nursing training) is also being phased out, the excuse being to bring us into line with the E E C. But in Holland, for instance, all midwives are direct entry and have a three-year midwifery training. Without direct entry, women who really wish to become midwives are denied the option unless they are prepared to go through nurse training first.The struggle of midwives to have their skills recognized is part of the increasing awareness amongst women of their oppression. We need to keep and add to our store of knowledge of normal birth processes before it is too late - to add to our woman-tending, not machine-tending skills.Student midwives are conditioned to doubt their own skills and accept an inferior status to doctors. This conditioning is easy since, as women, we are all conditioned and trained to be supportive to others (especially men - our boyfriends, husbands, children) and not to recognize the potential of our own talents.If midwives and nurses are to challenge the medical establishment, student midwives and other trainees need support so that they can take back the power of their own knowledge and skills.With thanks to everyone who I talked about it, especially Mavis Kirkham, Pippa Mackeith, Chris Allen and Caroline Mackeith.SR.71, August 1978       Pen Dalton, SR. 34, April 1975  
‘My World Became the Size of the Baby’CATHERINE BALLARD AND HILARY HACKETTI was alone in the house. The baby was asleep upstairs and I had lots of ordinary things to do. Suddenly I was totally overwhelmed by feelings of panic and terror. My feelings both mental and physical were as if a tiger had walked in the door, so that I was alerted, panic-stricken and in complete turmoil. I had this terrifying sensation that I had somehow snapped.About 80,000 women every year seek help from their doctors for emotional disturbances of varying intensity following childbirth. This whole area of disturbance, not clearly understood, is usually loosely labelled ‘post(after)- partum (birth) depression’. Yet it may not necessarily take place in the immediate post-partum period, nor take the form of depression, nor include feelings of aggression towards the baby, as is often supposed:If I had felt more obviously miserable or had begun to dislike my child, something might have clicked for us all about what was wrong with me. (Mother of five-month-old baby diagnosed as having ‘severe post-partum depression’.)What then is post-partum depression? According to a consultant gynaecologist:It’s all bunkum and baloney...But a consultant psychiatrist said:Bloody gynaecologists and midwives fill my wards with desperate women.The period following childbirth is necessarily one of adjustment to great change in a woman’s view of herself and in her relationship. Many women we talked to said that they felt themselves to be in a fog of exhaustion and doubt. Doctors ‘comfortingly’ reassure them that after about six weeks or ‘when the cycle re-establishes itself’- things will ‘sort themselves out’. They ignore the terrifying feelings some women have: shock, insecurity, inadequacy confusion and resentment; fears about their ability to love or look after the child; inexplicable states of tension and difficulty in relaxing and sleeping; sensations of having lost their ‘real selves’; new and unpleasant feelings about their bodies and sexuality; guilt feelings sometimes associated with disappointment about the child’s sex or looks; loss of concentration and appetite; an obsession with the baby and its routine.One afternoon the baby was asleep in the other room. I fell into a deep sleep and after about ten minutes he began to cry. I went to the cot and shook him and shouted ‘Shut up for God’s sake!’ I felt I had to sleep and sleep. That was the most important thing, he yelled so much and I was shattered.The day I came home from hospital, I realized that I’d never be able to follow my own line again.Immediately after Joanna was born I felt really sexy, but by the time the stiches had healed I couldn’t face it. The baby seemed to take all my energy. I couldn’t have cared less about him and his demands.I felt fantastically happy with the baby and also with Jonathan, my first child. I didn’t particularly want my husband near me, in fact I got him to sleep downstairs. I can remember feeling tremendously happy in the bedroom with the two children, because Jonathan came to sleep with me as well, which my mother didn’t approve of.I was shocked to see myself in the mirror. My body looked flabby and worn out. I couldn’t imagine anyone ever wanting me again. Worst of all, I still couldn’t wear anything but my maternity clothes.The man I was living with was so battered by the change the baby made to his life that we actually sat down one night and contemplated separating. But the next morning it all seemed horrible and ridiculous.At this point [after birth of second child] I stopped having any ambitions about finishing my research. I gave up completely. I found that I had less and less to talk to Alan about, apart from the children, that was our shared life. After this our sex life was less good, our marriage rests very much on the children now.Such feelings may come and go during the first few weeks of the baby’s life and then disappear completely. Or they may be, or may become, more intense and begin to swamp a woman. She may be quite unable to ‘snap our’ of her moods which might continue for a year or longer.Sometimes feelings of inadequacy and resentment develop into real depression: total inability to face even the easiest day, to perform simple jobs or make decisions, and perhaps self-hatred or hostility towards the baby. Tension and irritability become physical and mental panic: trembling, dizziness, morbid horrors of sickness and death, phobic anxieties about going out, being alone or talking to people. Moods may swing between euphoria and despair, between over-protectiveness to the baby and lack of interest in it. A woman in this state may well not realize that she is disturbed; each of her feelings will probably seem real and reasonable to her as she experiences it. Other people will find it difficult to understand even if she can explain. One woman, who went through many anxieties, realized that she had struggled alone to rationalize them:... it was the weather, or it was anaemia, or it was going back to work, or else it was my relationship with Paul. I had reasons for everything: it was my lack of routine or my personality, but never that it was something to do with post-natal depression. I never once dared to admit that. I don’t know why I was so frightened of it, that would have been an admitting of failure I suppose.It is often difficult for a woman who has post-partum depression to imagine what she was like before it began - the change in herself has taken place so suddenly. One woman explained her shock at a sharp return to a normality which, although an immense relief, was different from the way she felt before she conceived:One morning, when he was about six monthly old, I just woke up feeling different. It was right from the start, I recognized myself. I kept waiting for this happiness to slump back, but it didn’t. What it was was just ordinary, everyday OK, different to when I had been pregnant and before, and from then on I was feeling really great.Perhaps one or two women in 1,000 become seriously psychotic after childbirth, and may have to be admitted to psychiatric wards straight from the maternity hospitals. This can happen to women who have no known history of emotional disturbance and in most cases the outlook is very good and recovery complete. Psychotic mothers may refuse to acknowledge that the baby is theirs, revert completely to childlike behaviour or experience paranoia or hallucinations.All this, from the long-lasting anxiety state to severe psychosis is a far cry from the ‘third day blues’, that period of weepiness which the baby manuals predict will hit most mothers ‘when the milk comes in’, and after which they are expected to cope, to be themselves again, serene, capable and cosy. Yet...One morning I bathed the baby and did everything, saw that was in order, and I can just remember having the feeling that they’d all be better off without me, because I’m finished. And I took an overdose, a very bad overdose. (Woman describing herself as she was when her baby was six weeks old.)It is just not known why some women break down under the stress of the particular changes of childbirth, while for others the problems do not become serious.The most usual explanation for post-partum depression is ‘hormone imbalance’ but reports of depression in father’s and adoptive mothers indicate that the causes are not purely physical. Nevertheless insufficient research has been done on hormone levels following delivery and on the connection between hormone levels and mood states. The information that is available seems to be contradictory and has aroused little interest in a male-dominated profession. I’ll also argued that it might be the state of anxiety and depression which ‘unbalances’ the hormones, in the same way that anxiety is known to disturb the menstrual cycle. In any case, it is absurd that so little research has been done and that there is still no widely accepted hormone treatment for post-partum depression when a link has been recognized for many years. However, to attribute the whole phenomenon to hormones is to miss the vitally important question of how different women will react to a life-crisis which is psychological and social as well as biological.Recently a lot of publicity has been given to another explanation - the birth situation. Research has centred particularly on the psychological effects of induction of birth, the use of pain-relieving drugs, the separation of the mother and baby following the birth and the effect which this has on their relationship. While it is very clear that a bad birth experience may adversely affect the mother’s feelings for her baby and may also cause more general depression, this too does not provide the whole answer. The actual experience of birth is of crucial importance to the mother and it will remain clearly imprinted on her memory for the rest of her life, but some of the mothers to whom we talked had become depressed after really good home births. For example, both these women had easy deliveries at home:It wasn’t panic about can I look after the baby, or the family, or the house. I was perfectly confident. There was no rational explanation for it, it just happened. Just terribly panicky and Oh God, how am I going to face the day, how am I going to get through it, and there was absolutely nothing happening in the day, nothing to frighten me at all.When the baby was about five weeks old I quite suddenly started getting these panics and I felt depressed and tense and exhausted and completely cut off from people and reality. And above all feelings of terrible inadequacy started coming over me in great waves, as though I’d never be able to manage anything. I couldn’t understand it, I’d felt so marvellous for the first few weeks, and that’s the hardest time.Other women have become depressed after the birth of each of their children, even though the births had taken place in very different circumstances, some ‘good’, some ‘bad’. Organizations like the National Childbirth Trust and the Association for Improvements in the Maternity Services can do a lot to help us regain control of our bodies during pregnancy and birth and to secure the best possible circumstances for delivery. But for most women the reality is, and is likely in remain, impersonal ante-natal check-ups, classes to learn a few ‘relaxation’ exercises and how to bath a baby, a hospital birth with drug and then home with a screaming infant and a tin of National Dried.A more general explanation is that of conflict with the false ideal of glowing motherhood and the perfect baby, perpetrated by women’s literature and lore, which influences most of us however realistic we think we are. There is a conspiracy of silence over this: other women, even close friends and neighbours, seem to be coping and they throw our (imaginary) inadequacy into relief. And because they (and we) struggle to keep up the front of competence, the myth that any woman can cope is perpetuated and it becomes very hard to discuss real feelings and anxieties with other women.I persevered with breast feeding, not because I gained satisfaction but because of propaganda, especially among the women I go round with.Conversations often stop at the level of the baby’s development and the mother’s health. However comments like these cropped up again and again in our interviews:Even now, after three children, I can feel very detached and strange about it. I often get this impression that perhaps I’m only playing with dolls after all and that it isn’t really true and that one day I’ll wake up and I’ll be twelve year old and they are dolls.I remember shutting myself in the kitchen with the radio on, so that I couldn’t hear the baby scream. I guess I must have been depressed.I remember knowing that I loved the baby, but I just couldn’t feel anything.Often it was only in retrospect that these feelings could be acknowledged.Our impression is that although all these explanations are important, the over-riding and under-emphasized factor is the identity crisis and dislocation of self brought about by childbirth, which most of the women we talked to were grappling to describe in their different ways. Puberty, establishing important relationships and the menopause are all seen as unavoidable stages of maturation, but in these we are primarily responsible only to ourselves. Childbirth is perhaps a greater crisis than those others in that it involves the creation of a dependent, separate being which demands radical changes in the mother’s personality and relationships.I feel spread thin, like peanut butter. You can’t bring up three children and still remain the same.Even when she’s at Nursery, and I’m working, I find it hard to shut her right out of my mind.Our research so far seem to show that there is a much higher incidence of admission to mental hospital following childbirth among working-class mothers. They may often have very little support from men and nowadays less from other members of their families or neighbours. The main problems are isolation, exhaustion and confusion:I can remember watching the woman next door through a gap in the curtains. She was hanging out her nappies and I used to wait for her to go back inside before I hung out mine, because I didn’t know what to say to her. I felt so down.I already had four kids when Tom decided to take on the greengrocery business, then I fell on with Sean. After he was born, business got very bad, I was so desperate I couldn’t take any more. I wanted to leave Tom but I couldn’t. I was worn out but I used to have terrible dreams about mountains of rotting oranges.I felt like a child. I wanted to run home to my mother and father and be a little girl again. I felt I was caught in a web, I didn’t know how to look after them all.If people around the woman are insensitive to her feelings then she may have to resort to totally bizarre behaviour to express her distress. Such women have been picked up by the police, doggedly pushing the pram around the centre of the city after dark, or have broken windows or smashed up their most prized possessions. They may then be hospitalized, labelled ‘disturbed’, and only then, if they are lucky, will they have the chance to sleep enough, eat enough, get to know themselves and (if there are nursery facilities available) their babies, and to think things through.Many middle-class women, by the nature of their education, have been conditioned to believe that they should be able to cope alone, with ease, in all situations. They expect and are expected to play the superman role as mothers, continuing to succeed professionally at the same time as being ‘good’ mothers. Although they may be able to analyse and articulate their feelings and so may avoid hospitalization - perhaps because they can approach their G Ps with confidence - nonetheless they may find themselves in equally frightening situations:I really was in an awful state and for days and days all I could concentrate on was a game called ‘Chinese Chequers’. Nick, God knows how he went through it, and I just played this child’s game over and over again.I became agoraphobic, it really undermined my personality, but I was able, by bits of strategic planning, to go out occasionally with someone else, and for a long time nobody knew.I was somehow behind a black curtain. We thought it must just be the culmination of overwork and exhaustion. And when I say the doctor he was completely thrown by this ranting and raving middle-class woman.Such a woman can neither easily accept guidance from traditional sources nor from people who formerly gave her support:I was in a consciousness-raising group and I used to go and they’d say ‘How are you feeling?’ and I’d say ‘Oh, O K’, and leave it at that. What had I got to say? I was just in a middle and you can’t talk about a middle to people, can you?How then can a woman assess when things have got too much for her to bear, admit this to herself and to others, and find support and help?For dealing with the immediate problem, either a good G P or other women who are able to step out from behind their own facades can be very helpful in explaining that feelings of conflict and inadequacy and other, stranger, psychological symptoms are not as unique to her as she thinks they are. Unfortunately, few doctors are sensitive enough, or have the time, to give support to the woman and those around her over possibly a long period, reassuring her that her feelings are not unusual, ‘wrong’ or ‘mad’.All the psychiatrist could tell me was that my problem was ‘trying to be a woman in a man’s world’ and that I should ‘settle down with my baby’.The time necessary for every mother’s adjustment to her new situation must be recognized with patience by those around her and particularly by the woman herself. The new physical demands on her are stressful and at the same time she will be working through great personal change often in a state of heightened emotional awareness. This makes her very vulnerable to pressures from other people, such as criticisms about the way she looks after her baby, suggestions that she is too preoccupied with it and has cut herself off from her old life and become a different person. It can take many months even for a strong and self-aware woman to feel really competent to care for her baby, to become immune to other people’s conflicting advice, to come to terms with herself and to feel ready to return to her social life and her job.It is very important that, while accepting this, she makes every effort not to isolate herself, arranging support and help in looking after the baby, and learning to trust her own judgement. Ideally both men and other women should give their time and practical help to the new mother, and it is necessary for her to become less precious about doing everything for the child herself. Of prime importance is the relationship with husbands, closest friends, mothers and so on. A depressed and ‘irrational’ woman usually arouses sympathy in the first instance, particularly where there is an obvious reason for her state. However, when depression has become chronic the initial sympathy may fade - the woman should ‘pull herself together’, she has ‘added responsibilities now’ and ‘cannot go on like this much longer’. These attitudes are not necessarily aggressive nor do they indicate that a relationship has broken down. It is essential that a woman shares her real feelings with others: if you have a good G P let him talk to your husband, mother or whoever else thinks that your distress is trivial. You need space and freedom from pressure. Make yourself known.We have found in our research that many women who experienced post-partum depression failed to recognize their symptoms or were extremely afraid of them. But it is difficult to know just how much heavy publicity about the possibility of depression a pregnant woman can take. Nevertheless, those of us who have been depressed should not be ashamed to talk of it openly, and at last the baby manuals are becoming more realistic about how a mother will feel after the birth of her baby. For example:A feeling of anti-climax follows the first overwhelming sense of achievement and excitement and all of a sudden she’s at rock bottom, and left wondering why.In a very few cases, a mother may develop a severe post-natal depression. She loses her ability to cope. She may reject her baby. This has very little to do with a passing black mood. It’s no good jollying her along, telling her to take it easy and it will pass. She needs sound medical advice and help..... Some days may go like a dream. Others may seem hellish. You’re cross with your husband. You can’t stand his mother’s advice. You’re over-tired. You hate the baby. It seems to cry non-stop. You’re overwhelmed and feel you can’t cope...(From New Baby, a Health Visitors’ Association Publication 1975 - handed out free at clinics.)It is in be hoped that this is a sign that Health Visitors are becoming aware of the need to look out for symptoms of depression for a long time after the birth.Many other societies - and our own until a few decades ago - have social mechanisms to effect the transition into motherhood openly and smoothly, giving the individual woman a pattern to follow and protecting her from stress and isolation. Rituals are performed involving the whole family or community to mark the birth and events such as weaning, first haircutting, first tooth and so on. The birth of a child is not treated as a private act of production but as an event which concerns and changes the whole social group. However, in such societies, unlike our own, extended family relationships are still strong.In our culture, celebrations as part of an outward sign of caring and an acknowledgement of achievement are in short supply. Flowers, congratulatory cards and presents are pleasant, but in a way distant, depersonalized and soon over. Apart from the Christening service, which is much less common than it was, the only public ‘ritual’ is the postnatal examination at six weeks which puts the final seal on having had the baby.Until then you are allowed to feel vaguely poorly, but after the ‘Right, fine, well done!’ you are publicly given a clean bill of health and that’s it.Modern European society tends to promote the ideal of the lone, independent and self-determining individual. The responsibility for personal and psychological adjustment is placed squarely on the shoulders of the individual woman at a time when she is most vulnerable. One way out of the loneliness and strangeness which childbirth inflicts on us today is to share the experience with other women. Kate, whose baby is six months now, still meets three women from her ante-natal class every day. ‘We would have been friends anyway we share a lot of interests.’ They babysit for one another and generally give each other support.Mary describes how she and a group of women used to ‘coincide at the Welfare Clinic’. It was years before the growth of today’s women’s movement and it never occurred to them to meet consciously as a group. She says, ‘I never knew if the other women were depressed too. We’d moan a lot about our husbands - “them” - it was therapeutic. But we were very competitive, always eying each other’s babies.’Looking back she believes it would have helped her enormously if they had had the confidence to meet on a regular basis, perhaps discussing books or articles they had all read, particularly those which emphasize the mother’s point of view. She suggests that women stick up a notice in their Welfare Clinic inviting others to form a group:You’ve got to try and fed some connection with the outside world, with adults, otherwise you lose touch with your adult self. I think that sort of all- encompassing world that you slide into when you have a baby is dangerous because you become paralysed and dependent. Meeting other women, reading and talking weans you.A group of women of Hackney, London, decided last year to meet regularly once a fortnight after their babies were born. Joceline describes how the group helped her:I thought my life wouldn’t be changed much by a baby. It took me over though - a child really brings out your deepest anxieties. I started relating differently to situations - everything became difficult, problematic; cleaning the house, washing nappies, even drinking a cup of tea. I also felt differently toward people, but my friends related to me as if I was the same and I tried to live up to their expectations. I couldn’t; I freaked out, got paranoid and became a recluse with my baby and my world became the size of the baby. Then I started getting together with a couple of other women with young babies. ‘I just scream into my pillow at night and sometimes feel like killing myself,’ one of them told me. I felt a shock of recognition. Every time we meet now we check out what we have gone through, compare, analyse and feel a lot of mutual support.Finally then, a willingness to step out of our own image consciousness, giving consistent care and support, and recognition that looking after a baby is hard, life-changing work, are some ways in which we can all make the post-partum period positive rather than destructive. We would then be helping each other towards a creative acceptance of our own identities and of the interdependent and always growing identities of our children.SR.47, June 1976       Pen Daulton, SR.34, April I97S
AgoraphobiaHILARY WILCE At sixteen Carolyn Maniford became a patient in a psychiatric hospital because she was too frightened to leave home, even to go shopping or to travel to work. Carolyn’s situation is extreme but her case history is similar to that of many agoraphobics. There are quarter of a million known agoraphobics in this country, the vast majority of them women. The actual number of sufferers may well be nearer half a million for the apathy and intolerance of many doctors cause too many other agoraphobic to keep their bewildering fears a shameful secret.Agoraphobia is commonly known as a morbid fear of public places. Sufferers often prefer to define it as a fear of any situation in which they feel trapped. Neither definition gives any indication of the true misery of people made prisoners by their fears. Isolated, they live in a twilight world of panic and apprehension, where a train journey is a total impossibility and the corner shop might as well be on the other side of the world. And they live alone with their fears because, as one agoraphobic says: ‘How do you explain to anyone the terror you feel at the thought of walking down your own street? It would almost be easier to have some son of obvious, physical disablement.’Like most illnesses, agoraphobia varies in type and intensity. At one end of the scale is the girl who occasionally feels unable to face travelling on the Underground; at the other end is the housebound housewife who never, ever goes out, who cannot bear to stay on her own and who is perhaps too frightened to take a bath or wash her hair.But the varied fears of agoraphobics refuse to fit neatly into one phobic slot. If someone is terrified of crowded lifts or crowded trains, they agoraphobic or claustrophobic? The answer is probably, both. Agoraphobia can also be accompanied by specific phobias - a dread of heights, bridges, clouds - and anxiety and depression states are common among sufferers.The majority of cases of agoraphobia develop when people are in their mid to late twenties. For some, the fear builds up slowly over a number of years, gradually becoming more and more unbearable. Twenty per cent of agoraphobics were also school phobic when they were younger. Other people find themselves suddenly, and for no apparent reason, experiencing a full, phobic panic.... At seventeen Carolyn Mantford is a patient in Goodmayes Hospital, a grim-looking psychiatric hospital in Essex. She is an agoraphobic and has been in hospital for three months.‘It started for me when I was eleven and at secondary school. I found it difficult to mix and would get into corner all the time. Then it got worse and when I was fourteen I found it difficult to go to school. I had to run all the way because I couldn’t face walking. I thought everyone would know how I felt and laugh. When I got to school I’d hang round outside the classroom plucking up courage to go in.‘In my last year I played truant a lot and would lock myself in the house. Then I left school and I found I couldn’t mix at all. I couldn’t travel on trains, buses, tubes, anything. I had ten jobs in six months - I just kept taking new ones to see if I could suck them out. My last job was on a farm. I liked that. I used to feed the chickens and it was really peaceful. But it was a long bus journey and the psychiatrist I was under withdrew my tranquillizers to see if I could manage without them and I just couldn’t get there any more.‘So then I stayed in the house for several months. It was awful. I became scared stiff of my parents and kept the curtains drawn because I couldn’t bear daylight. I came in here then.‘I don’t like being here but I can’t get home. There’s no one there all day. I’d be completely on my own and if there was no food in the house I wouldn’t be able to go across the road and get some.‘I can talk to my dad but I can’t seem to get through to my mum. I’ll sit for hours explaining how I feel and then she’ll just say something that goes against everything I’ve been trying to say. Last Thursday I went for her. She said I’ll end up properly mad, I’ll end up in the main block here. I can’t bear people saying that to me. So I hit her about the head and my dad had to pull me off. Now it’s at the back of my mind all the time.‘We don’t do much in here. I walk up and down the corridors or sit and think for hours on end till I get really depressed. If I need something from the shop at the gate I force myself to go out but I have to take a bag to grip on to and I feel really awful. I go for walks round the grounds with a girl here but only because she wants to, and because I can’t tell her I’m terrified.‘I see a psychiatrist here but only for a few minutes at a time. The other one I was under left suddenly. We didn’t know he was moving. Quilt honestly, I’ve been pushed around so much by psychiatrists that I couldn’t care less about them any more.‘Apart from that we have meetings every day when we’re meant to talk about our problems. Everyone sits around the room in silence at first. I don’t talk much because once you’ve said what your problem is there isn’t much else to say.‘I don’t talk to anyone on the ward much. They’re all older. One old woman just keeps muttering something about Chelsea Town Hall. It drives me mad. I can’t seem to settle down here. Not like everyone else. ‘I like art and I’ve thought about doing nursing or heavy work, like on the farm. But I don’t think I’ll ever get bench. Sometimes I think I’m in here to get worse.’...SR.3, September 1972
Liz: Alcoholics AnonymousINTERVIEWED BY MARSHA ROWE... My mother used to give me hot toddies to comfort me when I was sick or upset. When I left school I joined the Young Socialists for a while, but none of it made much sense to me and I left it when I got to University. I really enjoyed drinking, it got me over my shyness when I went to parties. But I couldn’t afford to drink that much on a grant, I didn’t go out to get drunk then. Bob and I got married when I was in my third year. The rationalization for it was that we weren’t allowed to live together because of college regulations which was a hassle. I brought to the marriage all the preconceptions about wanting it to be forever and always and a great relationship. I remember saying I don’t want to get divorced and his saying, ‘That’s bloody ridiculous.’ We’ve rather changed roles now.I don’t think I can honestly say I ever needed to go to pubs in order to meet people. Not like some of the others in AA, people who’ve obviously done all their socializing in pubs. When I got married I was still hung up on this being taken out for nice meals bit. I thought that was the height of sophistication. In fact, I always had this thing, that I would really have arrived the day I had a well-stocked cocktail cabinet and could say, ‘What would you like to drink?’ It never arrived, and it never will, because every time I bought anything I drank it as fast as I could.Then we came to London and that was a sort of nadir of my life. I’d wanted to be an actress and I was very involved with Bob. I still think I’m good on stage but I haven’t the inclination to uproot myself and go anywhere at any time twenty-four hours a day. I started supply teaching and I got pregnant.... I thought I’d have perhaps three at the time but when I did I found it was ghastly. Two kids are just a hell of a lot of work, they get jealous of each other. I remember I began to have morning drinks to sort of anaesthetize the mid-morning feed because it was such a strain having to cope with a bawling child while the other was feeding. Then I’d get sloshed you see, and it really used to be quite nice once I was sloshed, the housework and the children were all quite bearable. This was not drinking to get drunk, it was drinking to get into a state where I didn’t mind things too much. I don’t know whether Bob noticed. I think I told him. He took a very cavalier attitude to the whole thing.But then I remember I stopped. There was half a bottle of whisky left and I thought, ‘I’ve got to stop because I’m never going to do anything except look after the children and get sloshed,’ and then I started painting. That was the first time since being an adolescent. Then I thought, ‘Well, that’s all right. I’ve stopped for three months and I’ve got it under control.’ So I started drinking again just in the evenings, but there were days when I got very sloshed because I remember once being very, very drunk on a bottle of Greek sherry and weeping to a friend that I couldn’t go on. That’s when we moved to where we live now. I know every off-licence in the area, the hours they’re open, every single one. I can tell you where to go at what time of day and I’d do the rounds so none of them would know about my drinking. But then there’s the problem of empties, that’s ghastly. You buy all this stuff, usually in quarters or halves. I was topping up bottles by this time to make it look I hadn’t drunk much. I drank anything I could lay my hands on, but mainly whisky. We always had a joint account so it came out of ‘housekeeping’.By this time it began to get ugly. I’ve always lost my temper easily when I drank a lot, and Bob and this other guy who was living with us would come home and suggest we go out for a drink. I would have a couple of drinks with them on top of all the other drinks they didn’t know about. Then I would suddenly snap and all this shit would come out and later I felt dreadful about it. Bob used to hate the rages but I think he quite liked comforting me through the hangovers.Then we went abroad for a year. I was pregnant again. It’s interesting the way one has all these mechanisms towards good health built in because I couldn’t drink the last three months of my pregnancy. I’d get this terrific heartburn which was very painful. Although I got plastered the day we left because there was a hell of a lot to do. After we arrived there was no money to spare but then a cheap gin came on the market and I got stuck into that. That was about four months after we left England, and I was discussing women’s liberation then. I do think it is a terrible indictment both of me and the group I was in that I didn’t talk about it all with them. It wasn’t a proper consciousness raising group, it was sort of half consciousness-raising and half study. Drinking escalates very quickly. Well, it was only 11s a bottle, a small bottle would fit into my bag. It smelled foul. And brandy, I drank, and beer, in the morning or at lunchtime. Then I’d take the kids out in the afternoon to the swimming pool and I’d be pretty plastered then usually. I dunno.I don’t think I showed that many signs of it. Yet I would not remember things. I started having these memory lapses, blackouts they’re called, and I didn’t know who I’d been talking to or what I said and sometimes I wouldn’t know how I got from A to B. I’d lose twelve hours, that’s when it starts getting frightening. Bob would notice and I would ask the kids if I’d put them to bed the night before. I was scared I’d leave the kids in a locked car or something.It’s a nightmare because nobody understands. People say drink less, that’s the usual. But the minute I’ve had one drink it’s just not enough. By this time I was saying to people on an individual basis I’ve got a drinking problem, I’m an alcoholic, but nobody knew what to do. I tried to stop drinking again as a result of being involved with somebody else. I remember on the tail of a really awful hangover him saying you’ve got to stop drinking. I couldn’t keep going round with half my brain knocked off, and feeling so ill. I said I wouldn’t have another drink, which I’d said frequently before. Next time I was with him I said, ‘Right, I’ll have a beer.’ He said, ‘No, you won’t.’ I was absolutely livid, really furious. I flounced out of the flat and that was the first time anyone had stopped me taking the first drink. He didn’t know about alcoholism but he said you are psychologically dependent on this thing and you’ve got to break this dependency, and that means coming off alcohol for quite some considerable time, like six months. And I thought I’ll show you mate, and after this initial thing of flouncing off I thought, he’s right, I won’t drink for six months. I still haven’t made it six months without a drink but I didn’t drink for about six weeks after that.The first thing that happened when I stopped, it was awful, it was really awful, like hanging on a cliff. I really didn’t think I could manage it, I hadn’t got any AA philosophy at this stage, knowing that you’re only supposed to try and cope with a day at a time. It was six months here we come, which is a terrible mistake. After about three or four weeks I was feeling better, not suffering gastritis, and I didn’t have cramps in the night, visual disturbances and I didn’t get up vomiting. I could remember there were good things about not drinking. I’d remember what I said to people, I hadn’t hit anybody and forgotten about it. But I was living on a knife edge.Then things began to go wrong. He broke off the relationship. But somewhere, deep down, I knew I mustn’t drink then; that I had to stay stopped, not to show him, but myself. I was only able to sustain that a couple of weeks. Then I was off on these periodic benders. First I wanted oblivion, then I’d think, ‘Oh well, I haven’t really stopped at the moment, and have another drink. It’s like snakes and ladders.A A groups help because people have been through the same thing. In terms of character types, I think there are a lot of people who’ve been very shy, self-conscious, inhibited, often really successful but inside just a quivering mess. There are probably a lot of people around like that who are not alcoholic. Nobody knows how many alcoholics there are, except there must be some people suffering with nobody knowing anything about it, realizing they’ve got a problem. Women are reputed to be more difficult to treat than men. They are more secretive as drinkers, and I think, because of the economic facts of life, women stick by alcoholic men longer than men stick by alcoholic women. And women usually drink in their home environment, which means that they are back in the drinking environment as soon as they leave hospital or whatever, it’s not like the pub, which a man can just avoid. At first, I got into a terrible state about the spiritual side of AA, but I think maybe if I’ve got to depend on something, it’s better to depend on a belief which may or may not be false than to depend on alcohol.Some people say the power of the group is the higher power, the power of AA and it’s true that it works.So I’ve stopped thinking of myself as the centre of the universe which I always did before, or I’m trying to stop. If somebody was angry before, I always assumed they were angry with me. I mean, people can be irritable about anything totally different, and just to get over that, and not see everything hinging on proving yourself, just see yourself as an ant essentially, one of the people and part of the universe. There are some people in AA who are atheists, but most people in groups revert to something like a god we were brought up with.It’s very weird, because now I can go around thinking bloody men, they’re always putting me down, and look at the differential between my earning power and that of Bob’s, and the fact that I look after the kids and nobody ever counts that in an incremental scale. It’s all bloody unjust and I could go round feeling that and get myself into a terrible state over all sorts of things. I learned to switch really, and think well, I’ve got the kids and I know where the next meal is coming from and you know, I’m bloody lucky, and I’ve got somewhere warm to live. I feel this is difficult to discuss with some women in the movement. You’re not supposed to take one step back. Well, I don’t think that’s true, in order to survive with any sort of equanimity at all. This whole thing AA has about resentment. In a women’s liberation group, you’re looking at the things you’re feeling angry about and validating your anger really, saying, ‘Yes, I’m right.’ But, in the end, unless you can actually go and change a situation, do something, you have this cancer inside you caring you away. It’s not the man who’s put you down, or won’t give you a job, who’s discriminating against you, who’s suffering, it’s you. Unless you can actually take action. A A has this prayer: ‘God grant me the Serenity to accept the things I cannot change, Courage to change the things I can and Wisdom to know the difference.’ It seems to me that what’s crucial is the wisdom to know the difference, because I differ from a lot of people I’ve met in A A about what that is - perhaps I’ve just been unlucky.I don’t have a straight environmentalist line about alcoholism. There are alcoholics, I’m sure, in every society. I really feel I ought to stay in AA but I feel pulled in two directions. What do I do when somebody makes a joke at an AA meeting, like I’d rather be watching a Miss World competition on the telly than being at an AA meeting. I don’t ever say anything in these situations. I’d be odd and isolated and I don’t fight it because it just upsets me, because I need to be there. I’m a socialist but one doesn’t talk about politics at AA, it’s all on this personal level and I suppose I feel isolated because I do connect the personal with the political and nobody else does. Anyway political arguments upset people and so it’s an area that isn’t discussed and the connection isn’t made. I really do feel I’m picking up where I left off about twelve years ago, before I started drinking. I’ve anaesthetized myself. There’s this terrible wilful bit you can’t control. When I’d go shopping, I’d walk straight over to the drinks counter in the super­ market, the number of times I’ve said half a dozen Coca Cola and a quarter bottle of whisky, and it’s just been out, just like that, and I feel this part of myself, reason has nothing to do with it. It might have rational beginnings, but now it’s totally irrational. Alcoholism is the third biggest killer. Society keeps bloody quiet about it, look how much money they’re making out of it. They put a government health warning on cigarettes, but they don’t on alcohol. It really is the opium of the people...SR 22, April 1974
Stretched to Breaking PointROZSIKA PARKER, JANE WILSON AND ALISON FELL... Almost half the patients leaving hospital in 1972 had been patients for less than a month. However, for many long-stay patients, hospitals live up to their name - bins, society’s dustbins. In the 1971 Census of Psychiatric Hospitals 65 per cent of patients had been in for more than two years and 29 per cent for twenty years or more.... The women’s sense of self-respect and their ability to help themselves were eroded. Patients, like children, are given no say in the running of their ‘home’ and no power to shape their own day. But what else does it mean to be treated as a child? They were constantly watched, ordered about one minute and patronizingly indulged the next. They had no rights and worked for nothing. If they inquired about their treatment they were met with ‘Because I say so’. Their descriptions of their feelings and experiences were discounted. And other people were licensed to punish and bribe them into ‘acceptable’ behaviour...Elaine... ‘I went around to a heck of a lot of different nurseries and foster homes and ended up in a kid’s home where I stayed for about seven years.’ After such a childhood Elaine needed time to herself, a space to discover what she wanted and respect for her privacy.The mental hospital where she went with heroin addiction provided neither peace nor privacy. She felt watched, manipulated and invaded.Here she compares the hospital to the therapeutic community where she finally came off drugs and where no coercion was used on the patients: ‘You could do what you wanted to do, go when you wanted to and sort things out for yourself with the help of other people.’Elaine can’t remember how many times she has been in mental hospital. Aged fifteen she was addicted to heroin.‘I first went in after I’d been using it for about five months. I was living at my boyfriend’s place. We got really bad, we’d just be lying around fixing and watching TV all day. And the heat - it was a centrally heated place so we’d turn it right up. We never did anything round the house and in the end Kevin’s father got really sick of it. You know, he was going out to work and paying our board and lodgings, yeh, he got tired of us.‘So Kevin went up there and pushed to get himself admitted. Then I went up because I had nowhere else to go - I couldn’t have stayed with his father.‘At first you’re really just sort of quiet. You don’t know what is going on. You’re nothing. You just sit and wait for the next meal.’Elaine was the youngest patient in the mental hospital. It didn’t bother her unduly but she was upset by the way the staff treated the elderly women. ‘Nothing was done for them apart from dressing them, feeding them, chasing them up and down the corridor or getting them back when they ran away.‘For a few people that place worked. It seemed to work for the housewives who came in for a nervous breakdown leaving six children at home. When they first came in they’d be put on pills and stuff. They’d rest and find people in the same situation who would sit around with them, knit and talk.‘When I first went in there it was pretty easy for me to leave again because people didn’t know me. But after a while I was stopped from leaving on the dot. They’d cut me down gradually. Once I was down I’d say, “I’m leaving, I’m going,” and so they’d put me to sleep. One        Ayme Rosenberg, SR.34, April 1975time they gave me sleep treatment for a fortnight. When I woke up I still kicked up and wanted to leave.’She fought to leave because she was frightened of group therapy. ‘There was no support in the group, nobody knew what they were doing. The stronger people would always pick on the ones who were quiet. There was no way you could get out of it and it completely broke me up. I used to sit there terrified that somebody would speak to me or ask me a question.‘Once I managed to get out of hospital I just forgot about the unit and started fixin’. Then we’d go in when we were fixin’ so much that the stuff ran out. You know, we’d still be withdrawing and we’d realize that we’d have to go in otherwise we were going to be really ill. You’d have to say that you really did want to come off and that you were really going to try - this time.’Elaine loathed the sensation that she was being controlled and constantly observed. She particularly resented the idea that she was being noted down and filed away: ‘All my life I’ve had a file behind me that I’ve never been allowed to see. I was in a kid’s home where they kept a file on me for seven years - annual and bi-annual reports. At the hospital they’d have staff meetings to read the cases. You’d walk past the office, see them chatting and think, “I hope that it’s not me they’re talking about.” Then they’d all come out and you’d know that they’d been told something about you.’Elaine rebelled. Perhaps it made her feel like somebody. ‘I was always a trouble maker. I used to disrupt everything and really was quite a nasty person. The staff said that as soon as I began to get on with them, I’d turn round and kick them in the teeth.‘When I went in I’d soon get together with a guy which in the end would turn out to be a right disaster. I didn’t think women liked me. The doctor said it was because they were shit scared I’d take their man away.’Eventually she was sent to a small therapeutic community in the country where she lived with about eight other addicts and ‘a guy called Simon who was more or less one of us, although he hadn’t used drugs.‘There you didn’t get hassled. You were just treated as someone who had a problem. You were sort of on your own and you had plenty of time to think - that was the main thing.‘In the summertime we’d just get up and lie out on the lawn and in winter we’d sit by the fire and play records. The people in the village called us dirty junkies. They’d stare at us through the gates - that brought us together. You didn’t have to go to group therapy and try to think of something to say. The only meetings were to decide who was going to cook, wash up and clean the front room. People would stay there for about six months and then just sort of leave and get a job. I did.’SusanSusan went into hospital feeling depressed, isolated and defeated. She wanted somewhere to escape to and she needed people prepared to ‘work’ with her through her problems. It was a relief to be committed - to cease to be a capable person, but she was still ashamed of being unable to cope.With these mixed feelings she came slap up against the authoritarian structure of hospital life; the rules and the petty indignities. Her depression gave way to fury. It was a familiar pattern with her.Instead of allowing her to use or express her anger, the hospital tried to threaten and dope her back into passivity. They gave her no chance to work through her feelings. They no longer defined her as ‘sick’, but as a ‘trouble maker’, disrupting the carefully controlled fabric of the institution. Looking back she feels that nothing positive came of her rebellion: ‘It was just me against the system, as usual.’For two years Susan had been a social worker; slowly the barrier she had erected between her own problems and those of the women she worked with broke down. ‘Instead of being the social worker, the responsible figure, the one who made the decisions, I completely crumbled.’        Ayme Rosenberg, SR.34, April 1975Six months previously she had got married. ‘All my life I had had this big thing about getting married. There’s always been that to look forward to. Eventually someone was going to come a long and love me. Then, when it happened... he’s a really great guy and all that, but wasn’t there something else? Wasn’t there a bit more?‘I had absolutely no friends except for Tom who I leaned on heavily. He worked in the evenings and anyway I wasn’t usually home until two or three o’clock in the morning.‘Then in the space of about two day I just completely closed off. I just went right inside. I just wasn’t connecting at all. Tom phoned the doctor. She just took one look at me and said that I should go inside to protect me from myself. I’ll never forget it - the sense of relief, the almost immediate sense of case. It was kind of letting it all out, it was over, I was going in, I was going to get fixed, I was going to get cured.‘I arrived there and I stood still in the hallway - it was just a big room and there were all these terrifying people. I knew I was sick, but I wasn’t... there were old men urinating and playing with themselves, there were young men - dossers come to dry out, there were women who were... who just kept trying to kill themselves. ‘I just wanted to hide but they made me go in and sit in the room with all those people. I couldn’t stand it. I was crying and I said to Tom, “Please I don’t want to stay here, please take me home with you.” He started crying and he said, “Please, I can’t help you, let the doctors try and help you, please stay.”‘Like Elaine, Susan felt dazed and stupefied at first. Her bed was the only place where she felt secure. ‘All I had was this bed.’ But the staff wouldn’t let her stay on her bed, they continually urged her to ‘sit with the others’.Gradually, her stupor gave way to fury: ‘I thought, they’ve no authority over me, these little girls in their pin stripes, they’ve no experience of what I’m feeling and yet they think they are above me. There were so patronizing and condescending. I could wear it a bit from the doctor but I couldn’t wear it from those little nurses. I was no feminist then. They were a thorn in my side. You’d queue for your pills, stand there in front of them and swallow so that they could check you had taken them. Within a week, far from being depressed, I was the angriest person in the world.’Susan soon learned that the hospital operated on a system of punishment, threat and reward. ‘I was basically a tough person but I still got really knocked under. You see I knew that if I screamed or broke a window they would just shoot me in the ass with largactil and drop me in my bed. Then there was the whole blackmail thing of “How dare you question what we’re doing. You’ve come here completely broken to pieces and we’re putting you together again our way. If you don’t like it you can go, there are plenty of people queueing up to be admitted.”’As well as the staff/patient power structure, Susan was aware of the rigid hierarchy amongst the staff, with the consultants at the top and female Black student nurses at the bottom. Attitudes of the women on Susan’s ward towards the staff on the lower rungs of the ladder varied: ‘People had contempt for them or liked them simply because they had no authority - no power. It was always the student nurses who made contact with you. The rest of the staff had no time to sit and chat because they all had administrative work. If you tried to talk seriously to the students about their lives or your own, they got nervous. May be they felt that kind of talk was the doctor’s job.’Susan echoed others’ criticism of the doctors; they had no respect, they didn’t listen. However, she says she saw the doctor more than most of the women in with her. ‘I know lots of women who didn’t get to see their doctor after they were admitted. I did - perhaps because I was more vocal or perhaps because my husband was middle class and       Ayme Rosenberg, SR.34, April 1975could speak their language. Anyway, in two short sessions the shrink put together a file on me, had me sussed out and this was me - an alcoholic who was very anti-authority.‘The most humiliating thing was the Wednesday morning meet-the­ chief session. It was a massive power trip for the consultant. He never knew any of the patients but once a week you’d be called in to see him and he’d go through your file. You’d be a jittering bundle of nerves all morning; you were afraid of what decisions he was going to make about you when he knew nothing about you except what was written on the file or what the other staff told him.‘It was like a magistrate’s court with all the staff who wanted to learn the tricks of the shrink trade sitting in. He doesn’t even know your name. He pulls out your file and flicks through It. “Mmm, I see you are anti-authority and have an alcohol problem.” I said, “You don’t see or know anything.” “Yes,” he said, “the file’s correct, isn’t it.”’The staff objected when Susan built up a group of friends: ‘They didn’t like it. You see, we were supporting one another. We’d go on strike; wouldn’t go to Occupational Therapy, wouldn’t go to bed when lights went out and wouldn’t eat shitty food. I got dragged out of bed one day by one of my friend’s shrink. He asked, “What’s the story with this little group?” He was very cool and trendy and actually treated me as if I had half a brain. It turned out that he was worse than my straight shrink - he just wanted to get into my knickers. I was just a fun fuck.‘I thought it was the screw of the century. It was me fucking the hospital, getting my own back, because it gave me a hold on him.’SR.43, March 1975
With a Little Help from OurselvesCAROL MORRELLRe-evaluation counselling - more often called co-counselling- is perhaps the most radical of the radical therapies: it is peer group therapy. You work on what is important to you, and at your own pace. Nobody directs you or analyses what you say. This allows you to be in charge of your emotional life. You are not regarded as ‘helpless’. Especially for women, taking our therapy into our own hands is the first step towards self-realization.The theory of re-evaluation counselling, as developed over the years by its founder, Harvey Jackins, is deceptively simple. The genius of the idea is in practice more than theory. Jackins noticed, as many others have, that the functioning of society (including behaviour, roles, values) depends on the systematic and forceful repression of emotions. Take a small child. When it feels sad or happy, it expresses those feelings, usually loudly. This is the healthy thing to do; the child doesn’t need to be taught that. When the emotion being expressed is anger or fear or tears, it is immediately cut off by the parent. The adult was stopped too, as a child: the sound of her own child crying reminds her bow painful it was to stop crying herself. She is ‘re-stimulated’ and must stop that noise: and she must repeat the way she was brought up to behave. ‘Shush shush darling, don’t cry’, or ‘Boys don’t take on so. You’re a little man now’: familiar comments. The child soon learns to apply that outer restraint to itself, stops shouting and crying, and we say ‘how grown up he she is getting’, admiringly.But with the stifling of feeling goes the inability to function well, perhaps even to think. If a child is allowed to express its fear, until it spontaneously stops shaking and perspiring, the immediate result is a happy smile and renewed interest in the world around. The situation has been coped with in a healthy way. The next time a fearful situation arises, the child will again experience being afraid. But it will not experience being afraid for the last event and the time before that, on top of the present fear. The surest way to train up a child into a fearful adult is to refuse to let it express feelings of fear.Emotions, if not expressed, gradually tighten inside until we cannot express them. Worse, the events that produce emotion still occur, have a tendency to set off the same sort of emotion, which adds to the original feelings, the whole mass of which becomes more and more tightly repressed. So we can keep functioning. But now, as a result of repressing ‘undesirable’ feelings, we function in a highly patterned, unintelligent manner. We never do anything new. Instead of responding to a situation, or a person, we avoid what is likely to be emotion ­ producing or act in a repetitive way. In order to cope. All the time. Noticing these patterns in other people is easy, once you adjust your vision that way. We often say, ‘That’s her way’ or ‘I know what his response to that would be’: we think of patterns of behaviour as personality, but the personality, the individuality, is hidden beneath the pattern. It’s much less easy to see what our own patterns are, because part of the necessity to stop up emotion includes the necessity to not know, consciously, what troubles us or how we put the feeling out of sight. We just do it, repetitively, machine-like.The theory continues on to suggest that the only way to end senseless and repetitive behaviour is to get in touch with those painful feelings, to find out what causes them, and to ‘discharge’ or express them in a supportive context. The context is first the group, then a counselling partner. We will avoid facing alone the accumulation of pain and anger we all carry around, fearing that if the barriers are let down, heaven knows what will surge up, or for how long. Re-evaluation counsellors believe that once a certain amount of this hidden emotion is expressed, and some of the causes and results are understood, a ‘mental clearing’ happens which enables us to begin to break unwanted patterns and to function in more self-fulfilling ways.To co-counsel effectively, various skills must be acquired. Usually, a group of people meet with an R C teacher for a period of forty hours, spread out over perhaps two months. Between group meetings, people get together in pairs to practise what they’ve learned. Finally, you meet your partner once a week to carry on. Counselling is thought of not as a short-term therapy, but as an ongoing process through which we can become more conscious, more independent, more free from patterned behaviour.There are many techniques, none of which are difficult to learn. I’ll mention three that are especially relevant to women’s self-realization process. First, new counsellors are asked to build up a new habit of thought, by remembering what’s been good and new in the past few days. Many women, when asked this, really can’t think of a single good incident. By noticing things that are good and pleasurable, we can break the depressed habit of being conscious only of what’s wrong. Another important technique to learn is ‘free attention’. We all do a lot of listening, but how valuable is it? In co-counselling, you learn to listen with all your attention, not planning responses before the speaker has finished, not groping around, while she’s talking, for helpful advice to give. While we’re doing all that, we’re not listening. Not judging, commenting, sympathizing, or giving advice means that your partner has a ‘free space’ in which she can hear herself, and come to her own conclusions. Which are the only valuable conclusions anyway.A third technique is ‘self-validation’. This means liking yourself, and appreciating openly what you like best about yourself. One of the most pernicious ways in which women are kept from developing their individual potential is the subtle invalidation we receive daily. Just as harmful, is being appreciated for all the wrong reasons; for instance, being told how marvellously well we fulfil roles we haven’t really chosen and don’t especially like ourselves in. One woman was always told, ‘What a good listener you are’. Fine, except she often wanted those ego-tripping people to stop and listen to her once in a while. Better, she wanted more about her to be appreciated than her ears and ability to sit patiently still for hours. Her self-validation and direction for the future is, ‘You’ve got an hour to talk, because I like you. Then we do what I want.’Change is a slow process, perhaps because we can’t know what end­ result we want when we begin. We have an idea, but it will be modified in time. So we vacillate, go back on our best intentions, then take a couple of important steps forward, only to sidetrack once again. It’s useless to expect society or ourselves to pursue a straight line to a predetermined goal: that’s not an organic process. Change is better seen as the unfolding of real individual potential, and discovery, as the potential becomes apparent, of what we want it to accomplish in our lives. Re-evaluation counselling’s most important premise is that we can achieve that realization and put it to our own best use...SR.15, September 1973 
Opening Myself to ChangeFRANCES SETONThis article has been very difficult to write. I have had to try and explain how psychotherapy, which has helped me enormously, can be justified as an option for women within a feminist perspective. This has meant nor only describing my experience as a patient in therapy, but dealing with the anti-psychiatry arguments of feminists, radical psychiatrists and the friends who have helped me write this.I have been in therapy with a woman psychotherapist for about eighteen months. Psychotherapy is one of the many forms of help available, along with psychoanalysis, co-counselling, encounter, psychodrama, to name but a few. Many people are confused about the distinction between these forms of help. In psychotherapy you visit a therapist once to three times a week for a fifty-minute session when you sit and face your therapist, though some people choose to lie on a couch. Psychoanalysis differs in theory and in practice; you go five times a week for up to seven years and usually lie on the couch speaking to the analyst indirectly. Psychoanalyst is nearly always Freudian or Jungian while psychotherapy draws on many schools – Freudian, Jungian, Gestalt, Transactional and Behaviourist are the most common. Many therapists use a combination according to the needs of the patient. It is important to know about this and feel free to explore the kind of therapy and therapist you want.I found my therapist through my University Health Service where the G P referred patients only after discussing the individual’s case with the staff therapists and selecting the most suitable combination.When I first started psychotherapy I encountered opposition and discouragement as well as support and understanding. The most immediate support came from friends who had been in therapy (I had initially got the idea from them) and from two close friends who had recently started themselves. It was really helpful to share this rather alarming process with others who were familiar with the jargon of patterns, syndromes and neuroses.Other friends were frankly horrified or embarrassed by what seemed an admission on my part of a terrible disease, or deforming blemish.We are all expected to cope, and not to admit failure, although I am sure many of us have sufficient pressures in our families, relationships and work to make it very difficult to function well. Unhappiness bordering on depression or intense anxiety is seen as shameful or as a kind of illness. It’s repressed lest our admission of it threaten everyone else’s precarious facades of coping. However, I must admit I did see my decision to go into therapy as an admission of weakness. I was ashamed that I could not work things out for myself or within the structure of a women’s group.By admitting my need for some sort of help I began to learn important things. In the first place I had always appeared to others as strong, productive and together - a competence which was rather daunting. Once I was able to admit my own vulnerability to myself, many relationships became more equal. No longer did I always put myself into the unconsciously superior role of supporting others, instead we were able to share both our strengths and our weaknesses. I believe that women are conditioned into two conflicting roles; one tends to dominate and dictate the nature of relationships. There is the Big Mother role or the emotionally dependent Child. I had been trying to be the first and forcing close friends into the second. With my image of myself as a strong type, I experienced shame in having to admit need and dependence. We are all distorted by the inherent contradictions of these exclusive roles and a lot of work needs to be done to understand the way women relate to each other.In the second place I learned that to seek help was not an admission of abject failure, but the first step towards taking responsibility for myself, and freeing myself (and others) from the tyranny of my past. It was a matter of coming to a realistic assessment of my capacities and recognizing my healthy need of others.It requires strength to go through therapy and abandon all such defence mechanisms and behaviour patterns which had got me through in the past. Opening myself to change required an often painful process of self-discovery. I had to come to terms with feelings from which I had hidden - like fear of abandonment and strong self-hate - as well as those I could not allow myself like happiness, the capacity to love others and myself, and the expression of my sexuality.I was afraid of asking for help because it felt like reverting to childlike dependence. It was a realistic fear in view of the traditional image of therapy in which the woman goes as a patient to an omniscient professional who will make her better.Feminists have exposed the power structure in the patient-doctor relationship of psychoanalytic (Freudian) theory which is the basis of all other theories. The feminist critique is twofold: psychoanalytic theory propounds the idea of feminity as biologically/psychologically determined. Women want to be mothers and wives, argue the theorists, thus maintaining the role of women as reproducers of the labour force, servicers of workers and children, by making women believe that this is all a healthy, normal female should desire.Secondly feminists have attacked the patriarchal character of a therapeutic situation in which a desperate woman goes to a male counsellor and enters into a dependent relationship which repeats their social, emotional and often economic dependence on fathers, husbands, boyfriends and bosses. In Woman and Madness Phyllis Chesler not only exposes the actual sexual content of many therapeutic relationship, but also the use of class power by middle-class when men and ‘men-women’ who inflict treatment on working-class, Black and lesbian women. Thus the theory and practice of much psychological counselling seems to reflect the power relationships of patriarchal/class society.Juliet Mitchell in Psychoanalysis and Feminism has tried to reassess the value of psychoanalytic theory. Instead of attacking Freud, as many other feminists have done, for being prescriptive, i.e. telling women how they ought to be, she argues that his theory of the unconscious and the Oedipus complex describe the precise mechanisms whereby individual males and females are socialized into their respective roles within a patriarchal society.She also exposes the inadequacies of the radical psychiatrists’ arguments that it is the institutions of society which cause problems and that it is enough to attack them. One must also fully analyse the workings, origins and inter-relationships between the internal structure of the mind and external social structures. In a theoretical form she shows how the personal is political and how the material structure of social relations is placed in the structure of personality.To sum up - as I see it, in feminist and other radical critiques, psychology is seen to propound an idea of women that is false, oppressive and closely related to the maintenance of patriarchal society. But I don’t think we necessarily have to be manipulated by psychology, we can use it for ourselves. The discovery of the unconscious and the recognition of how it can be manipulated paradoxically provides us with the means to escape from socially imposed structures and to work towards new ones. So we can reassess the value of psychological theory to some extent, and I would like to argue that feminist criticism of the practice can also be challenged.In the light of the feminist condemnation of the whole process, how could I justify my choice to engage in personal therapy? In the first place the actual distress I felt was not at all relieved by the recognition that it had a social origin. When I decided to do therapy I was depressed, withdrawn and sexually frigid. And although I’d tried very hard talking, thinking and reading about it, I could do absolutely nothing about it. At one point I had even managed to make a list of eight possible explanations, but I was absolutely trapped and controlled by something that I did not understand and could not alter.I read all I could about psychology, which only provided me with a series of labels to describe my state and, more seriously, literally to hide behind. (A criticism I have of psychology and indeed medicine is that it gives problems a concrete existence separate from their origins.) Even when I read Karen Horney’s Feminine Psychology, which provided illuminating and basically feminist analyses of frigidity in the reproduction of the family structure in adult couple relationships, I did not find the means to solve those well-documented problems that I was so intimately experiencing. But I did find a spurious comfort in describing my situation in terms of psychologically validated ‘problems’. It was only when I went to a therapist with my neatly labelled ‘problems’ that I discovered I could no longer hide behind them. The pain was real and the labels irrelevant. I had to react to my pain either with masochistic self-pity or with a determination to change. I had to decide to go through to a new future or submit to the tyranny of my past and present.My University Health Service G P was surprised when I specifically asked to see a woman therapist. This was partly because I could not really talk to a man about sexual problems, and partly out of simplistic feminism. I had not really appreciated that within an essentially patriarchal institution, the presence of individual women do not necessarily, if at all, effect the nature of the institution. However a female therapist was in fact helpful because an important source of my distress was an unresolved grief, anger and resentment at my mother’s death which I saw as her abandoning me. In therapy I was making a relationship with an older woman, who was an authority figure in the situation, and on whom I felt dependent and needy. Through this I was able to exorcize the ghost of my real mother. I don’t think this is important only for people whose mothers have died. In the family, the mother wields enormous power by virtue of her role as socializer, sole nurturer, giver (and withholder) of love. Working with a woman therapist helped me to begin to break the power of the figure of The Mother that I had internalized.How that came about is simple to explain but hard to understand without actually experiencing it. Basically the present replaces the past. My therapist avoids talking exclusively about my childhood because she feels that explaining the cause of particular feelings does not necessarily alter them (and as I found out for myself, it sometimes does the opposite). But by emotionally recognizing that the way I feel and act today are programmed reactions set up in childhood, I have the possibility of changing how I feel and act now - of making new programmes.For instance I reacted to my mother’s death by totally suppressing my genuine reactions - I was brave, I coped remarkably well, while I really felt abandoned and rejected. And since I could not bring myself to blame her for abandoning me, I came to feel that it was my fault; I was unworthy of love or had done something to drive her away. Three patterns emerged: I was terrified to love anyone for fear that they would leave me, I clung desperately to my friends and lover by looking after them and winning love by being kind, and I took responsibility for anything that went wrong in any relationship. I was, therefore, dependent in a covert way, manipulative and riddled with guilt.I cannot isolate one dramatic moment that changed all this, but I came to trust my therapist. On a conscious level I was in a willed, self-chosen relationship with someone I came to trust. Unconsciously I was transferring to her some of my feelings about my mother.When my therapist was ill and then almost killed in a car crash, I dealt with that virtual repeat of my past differently. I did not identify her potential demise as abandonment nor did I blame myself. Of course, she didn’t in fact die, but had she died making some of the original feelings of guilt and abandonment emerge, they would have been exposed for my conscious recognition of their source and function. I realized that even someone on whom I felt very dependent did not have the power over me to damage me in the way my mother’s disappearance had. Thus therapy has worked for me by virtue of the very fact that it restages the authoritarian structure of the family in which personality formation takes place.The only way that I can explain that process is by saying that I have come to accept the existence of the unconscious. I knew about it intellectually but had never really experienced its effect. Moreover the idea of something over which I had no intellectual control was very threatening to me. All my education had taught me to be profoundly suspicious of such an irrational force as the unconscious. It took me a long time in therapy to stop myself from trying to ‘solve the problem’, to forego my educated inclination to give the ‘right’ answer. Analysis, explanation, understanding as rational activities do not touch the range of emotions that profoundly affect one’s life and to some extent actually dictate one’s intellectual outlook.I see therapy as a means to bring the unconscious and conscious into closer communication by a twofold process. I describe the first as falling through layers to profounder levels of consciousness; the second as a floating up of the buried unconscious to the surface.At the beginning of therapy I could not face the idea of making love to anyone - I had no sexual feelings at all. I responded so intellectually and ‘rationally’ to the situation that I could objectify that paralysis of feeling as ‘frigidity’. While many women argued that my ‘frigidity’ was caused by X number of reasons in my living situation and past, their suggestions simply could not touch me. I was so out of touch with my feelings that the contradictions in my feelings could only manifest themselves to me by a specifically sexual block.It is possible to unblock through a structure in which you have a time and place where you are committed to experience your feelings. But beyond that, the structured time and place serves as a focus for a process of recognizing, examining and living your feelings that should go on all the time. This basically means bringing the conscious and unconscious into closer communication. But the unconscious is beyond conscious control by definition and cannot be forced by either therapist or patient. Therapy only provides the opportunity to work things out for yourself. It does not work for everyone because patients can resist deliberately or unconsciously, often out of an unwillingness to change, or a desire for the therapist to confront their feelings for them.Because the real area of change has to be in the relationship between the unconscious and the conscious, I do not believe that consciousness raising alone can or should provide the same opportunity for psychological change. I was doing consciousness raising for the first six months of my therapy. It was a very politicizing process, one which I believe is crucial to the woman’s movement, enabling women to discover the common patterns of being female in this society by sharing personal experience. Up to a point it can duplicate the structure of the therapeutic session - a place to explore feelings. But because of the group’s democratic structure, it cannot reproduce the authoritarian nature of the family and society which I have argued is an essential part of the workings of therapy. Indeed the consciousness-raising group valuably tries to counter it with a collective model. It applies none of the pressure necessary to shake up the unconscious, and does not provide one figure to whom you relate so strongly that, if you want to, you can change the deeply rooted unconscious patterns of relationships. It is essentially, and usefully, consciousness not unconsciousness raising.A process of unconsciousness raising necessarily takes a long time. Therapy does not merely aim to analyse and relieve specific problems, but attempts to remove constrictions on the individual created by past experience, in order to make choice possible. My own therapy fell into two distinct phases. The first six months were goal-orientated and relieved my inability to function sexually. The second phase has been much longer and has made me think in terms of a process of permanent revolution that will continue beyond the end of structured therapy.Having begun to trust the process, to understand the workings of the psyche and how to use the tools of therapy, I can continue to work at it on my own and apply it to a larger social sphere. It is not a matter of cure, there can be no complete cure within a sexist, capitalist society. To be happy is not to be cured but to be or want to be self-determined versus patterned, autonomous versus dependent, to be able to make decisions versus being blocked, to accept vulnerability and needs versus false strength. And to be able to see oneself as separate and ultimately alone yet able to relate within society.But this is impossible for men and women within our society because we are divided and categorized into masculine (strong, decisive, rational and competitive), and feminine (emotional, indecisive and dependent). Through psychotherapy I have begun to free myself from the crippling effects of my past and have gained the means to explore the kind of social relations through which human potential can be realized in our society.I am not arguing for personal solutions - I’m all right, Jill - because I have been in therapy. I have found that the therapeutic process has given me a greater appreciation of political issues and motivation...SR.44, March 1976
How to Run a Health CourseBRENT WOMEN’S CENTREOrganizing a women and health course turned out to be really easy and exciting for our group. We’d like to share our experiences in the hope that it will inspire and help others to set up their own courses.The ten-week women and health course was organized by women from the Brent Women’s Centre with the help of two feminist workers from Brent Community Health Council. We decided to try and get a health course together so that we could gain knowledge about our bodies, our health rights and the facilities available to us. Because all women have so much contact with the health service - for ourselves and for our children and relatives - we felt that discussing health would be a good way of bringing women together.Women are always on the receiving end of male-dominated health care, for period problems, birth control, pregnancy, childbirth, menopause and depression. When women talk about how they feel about going to doctors, hospitals or clinics, they speak about feeling vulnerable and not knowing or understanding what is happening to them. If they do       Jo Nesbittquestion anything they may be labelled as neurotic or trouble makers. Too often we have no control over our bodies, and no power over what happens to us. Either we are sick and so feel dependent, or are well and made to feel as if we’re ill. Surely as women we are the best people to define our health needs and determine the kind of health care we want.Brent is an area in north-west London which suffers from over­crowding, poor housing, huge council estates with few facilities and high unemployment. It already has had severe cut-backs in its health services. Brent Community Health Council offered us their premises which are very central and easily reached by public transport. Not all CHCs are as open or involved in the local community as ours but it’s certainly worth encouraging yours to help out. We hoped that by joining the CHC we’d attract both feminists and women who were interested in health but not familiar with feminism.... When we started planning the course we felt a bit apprehensive. We thought we might need the help of someone with experience, so it was exciting to realize that we could handle it ourselves. This is, after all, what the course was about - the breaking down of the mystique of medical expertise, of our dependency and so-called ignorance. We could decide what we wanted to talk and find out about from our own experiences as women. We could find women who had expert knowledge about a specific topic who were willing to share it with us.As soon as we started talking about the course, ideas just poured out. In the end the subjects we chose for the course were:WOMAN’S BODY AND HOW IT WORKS. CONTRACEPTION. ABORTION SEXUALITY. MENTAL HEALTH.  CHILDBIRTH. MENOPAUSE AND AGEING. HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK. NUTRITION AND SELF-HELP.The order of the topics evolved, but with care. For instance we gave a lot of thought to where to put Sexuality. Many of us aren’t used to talking about sexuality; we had to get to know each other first and gain confidence before that discussion. We deliberately followed Sexuality with Mental Health, which we felt to be linked with sexual oppression. In retrospect we felt that Mental Health should have come towards the end of the course, as it became clear that it was linked with everything we discussed. Our last topic, Nutrition and Self-help, we saw as a positive end - in fact a beginning of taking some control over our own health. Of course we could only cover each subject briefly, and we emphasized throughout that each evening was an introduction and hopefully a springboard for more detailed discussion in follow-up meetings and courses.Each of us took responsibility for organizing the topics we were most interested in. We invited speakers on each subject, but were always careful to create a balance between women with expertise in certain areas and women familiar with those areas through their own experiences. For example, in the session on childbirth we invited a midwife and a local woman who had recently had a baby. For the session on ageing we invited a social worker from a local geriatric unit and a member of a local pensioners’ organization. The speakers were all women who were eager to share their knowledge, and did not create the ‘professional’ barriers that we usually meet within the health service. The speakers introduced their topics and then encouraged and participated in the general discussion. A measure of the success of this was that the discussion always flowed freely with women eager to share their experiences and views.To get speakers, we first contacted local women we knew who particularly knowledgeable about any of the topics. A local women’s centre, women’s or community groups should be able to help with this information. Where we could not find local women to speak, we used contacts to give us suggestions.We were very anxious to reach out to women who don’t usually go to meetings and courses, and hoped that the ‘right’ publicity would help. We also wanted it to be a local course, and so kept outside publicity to a minimum. We were lucky to have a sympathetic journalist on the local paper; she did some articles for us, advertising the course. We also produced a leaflet which we distributed through all the local community organizations, tenants’ associations, clinics, playgroups, doctors’ surgeries, health visitors and social services departments. Two local librarians organized a display for us in the libraries and produced a booklist for the course. We also used the women’s centre mailing list, and spread information by word of mouth. None of us had ever experienced such widespread and enthusiastic feedback to any projects we had been involved in before.Even though we did not have to pay for the premises, we reluctantly made a small charge of 25p a session or £1.50 for the whole course to cover speakers’ expenses, printing costs and tea, coffee and biscuits. There was no charge for claimants. We didn’t expect the amazing turnout (averaging fifty a session) and so unintentionally ended up with a profit! This was given to the women’s centre for future activities.A measure of our success was that we drew in women not usually involved in local campaigns or groups. But most were younger women in their twenties or thirties. We now see that this may have been because a large part of the course dealt with women in their ‘child­bearing’ years. This was one of the limitations of the course; we were reflecting society’s attitude that women cease to be important when they are no longer fertile. The other major frustration was the lack of time at each session. We weren’t able to cover any of the topics as fully as both we and the speakers would have liked.Although women could come to individual sessions, most came often or even for the whole course. The final sessions had no topic, but in spite of that we had a large attendance to discuss future activities. We kept a list of names and addresses, which has been added to the mailing lists of the women’s centre and the CHC. Many women from the course were actively involved in the local campaign against the Corrie Abortion Amendment Bill, and in the campaign against Depo Provera (a long term contraceptive injection with dubious side-effects).Also, as a direct result of the course, a new consciousness-raising group is meeting regularly, a successful pensioners’ health course has been organized by the CHC, and one woman is organizing a pregnant women’s support group. The course also gave women from a community centre in a neighbouring borough the confidence to set up a course of their own. Other ideas that came out of the course were for a workshop on childbirth, and a project for teenagers on sexual feelings and birth control.We were very excited by the course, particularly the feeling of support and caring throughout. The learning was a two-way process between those who ‘organized’ and spoke and those who came along each session. Discussing the course as a whole, a woman who had not previously been involved in an event for women only said, ‘The most important thing about the course was the warmth and supportiveness of the group. When you are involved in organizations with men they always seem to be competing with each other.’ Having it for women only helped provide a relaxed atmosphere in which to express our thoughts and anxieties, to talk openly and not feel threatened. Some women had previously experience of the women’s movement and were familiar with criticism of doctors and the N H S. Others had not questioned why they always felt inadequate in their dealings with the N H S or why they had an expectation of ‘suffering’. Women said that through the course they had discovered that their individual experience of the health service had many common features. Our discussions helped us all develop the awareness to question, and the courage to criticize the treatment we received - it raised our consciousness.Health courses have an amazing potential for bringing women together, and increasing our knowledge and confidence to strive for the kind of health care that we need. They help us understand the society we live in and give us a glimpse of a different society where we will have control of our health, our lives.SR.94, May 1980‘To Lose a Breast Seemed More Terrible than Dying’LIN LAYRAMWhen I finally made up my mind to leave my husband after a ten-year relationship I was twenty-eight and childless. Within a few month I was beginning to adjust optimistically to a new kind of life. I began a stable and interesting relationship with the man I now live with and for the first time experienced that a sexual relationship was a possible source of happiness. The hang-ups I had built up over years began to get resolved. For the first time I began to feel a pleasure and excitement from my own body that was not tied up with guilt. At this point in my life I discovered that I had cancer of the breast, and the breast had to be amputated (a simple mastectomy). The feelings I experienced are obviously a result of my personal situation, but may strike a chord for other women in the same situation, so I am recording what happened to me in as much detail as possible. I hope that it may help other women to be relieved of some of the unnecessary hurt and humiliation which I felt at the time.It was my boyfriend who first noticed the lump in my left breast. He persuaded me to visit a doctor which I did, albeit reluctantly. I did not however really believe at this stage that much serious could be wrong since I assumed (an assumption apparently shared by some of the medical profession) that breast cancer is a disease of middle age.1 The local, male G P was reassuring. He examined my breasts, said that it was a swollen gland common among women taking the Pill (which I had been on for seven years) and told me not to worry. He did not refer me to a hospital for tests but did mention in passing that I should call in again if the lump didn’t disappear. Over the next weeks I was relieved to find that the lump did seem to reduce in size. Looking back, I wonder how much of this was wishful thinking and imagination - difficult to tell with a lump that size - contained within a breast duct above the nipple and probably no bigger than a pea. Shortly after this visit to the G P I moved house and didn’t have any official doctor for around four months. It didn’t seem necessary as although I was often tired and suffered badly from headaches I had no definite symptoms of distress or illness.After this period my boyfriend and I moved back to North London. I made a routine visit to the FPA clinic to collect my contraceptive pills. At my visit I mentioned to the doctor that I had a small lump in the breast. She did not seem keen to examine me but finally agreed to look at it as it was time for an annual check-up anyway. After examining both breasts she said that she had found nothing. Feeling over-anxious and fussy I began to question her further. She replied by reassuring me that if I had a ‘cyst’ she wouldn’t be giving me the pill. As she said this she signed me up for a six-month supply.I should say that I am now ‘contra-indicated’ as regards the Pill. The hormones have a very bad effect on accelerating cancer of the breast.As I stood in the queue to collect supplies I decided to take out my treatment card and see what the doctor had written. To my bewilderment I read the words ‘Nodule in left breast’. I still find this incident inexplicable. The clinic doctor should have informed me, told me to contact my doctor at once and have ceased to supply the Pill. She did none of these things. I couldn’t face going back in to confront her so I collected the pills and went home feeling very shocked and puzzled. I picked up a leaflet as I went out which proclaimed ‘Don’t gamble with breast cancer!’ The leafier informed me that early treatment was essential and that anyone finding a lump should see a doctor immediately. The doctor had perhaps not read this leaflet! In my experience it was the doctors who ‘gambled’, not me.When I look back on these incidents I feel furious with myself for my spinelessness. Yet if the doctors would not take the lump in my breast seriously it was a great temptation for me to take their reassurances at face value. What woman does not dread that a lump will turn out to be cancer and that she will lose her breast and with it her sexual identity. These deeply repressed fears prevented me from fighting the apathy I encountered as I should if I were fighting for a sister in the same situation. I think this may be an important point in helping other women get treatment fast - to recognize the reluctance to fight an issue like this.Diagnosis of breast cancer in my experience cannot be made by your average or even better than average clinic doctor or G P. It can only be confirmed by a biopsy report and women, should insist on this as soon as possible - or other women should insist on their sisters’ behalf.It would seem to me that because of my age the doctors I saw discounted as statistically improbable the diagnosis of cancer and therefore did not even bother to investigate further, even though a woman’s life was at stake.A month or two after the clinic incident my breast began to actually hurt and throb (probably as an effect of the hormones in the Pill which I was still innocently swallowing down every day?). I had to hold my breast tightly in order to relieve the pain and in this state I felt compelled to again visit a doctor. My new G P actually took me seriously as I apologetically repeated my litany and after an examination she referred me to a consultant at the local hospital.As it was Christmas an appointment couldn’t be made until 1 January. At a party during that period I got drunk and broke down sobbing and hysterical with anxiety. Only at that point did I realize how my underlying fears were being repressed and how depressed all the foregoing experiences were making me.On 1 January the specialist examined me in Out Patients. I was also examined (without my permission being asked) by a male medical student.2 I was told I had a small cyst and that it would be wise to remove it. This could be done in three days in hospital. I was studying at the time so arranged my admission for a fortnight hence. I left feeling relieved. Everyone in my house was happy for me that things would soon be sorted out. My boyfriend was loving and supportive but I became depressed over the next week. I was feeling tired and ill and finally went down with gastric flu. I still went into hospital on the admission date of 19 January as my G P was afraid I would lose my place in the queue if I didn’t. I stayed in the hospital for three days but was not operated on after all because the anaesthetist said I was too weak from the flu to work on. They sent me home and readmitted me again the following week. I was diagnosed as having fibrokinosis (thickening of the fibrous tissue). During the few days that followed I was upset that the lump which was extremely render and painful was continually handled by long queues of male medical students and housemen. Never was my permission sought and I experienced for the first time what it is like to lie and be an object while jokes are made over your head, and remarks exchanged between consultant and respectful housemen, which do not include the patient as a feeling human being. (Incidentally, Our Bodies, Ourselves argues that potentially cancerous growths should be handled as little as possible.)The operation was fairly untraumatic although I was at the end of the queue and the pre-med had worn off by the time I got into the theatre. The lump was excised and a biopsy done. The stitches were neatly sewn around the nipple so as to reduce the scar. During this period I met women in the ward who were cancer and mastectomy patients. I was struck by their courage, their ability to make jokes. I was also shocked by the sight of one woman waiting for her wound to be dressed after a radical mastectomy and looking to me like a hot cross bun. To me to lose a breast seemed a thing more terrible than dying. Amputation of any kind had always filled me with pity and disgust. The last day I was in the ward the Australian houseman, shouted across the ward loudly as I chatted quietly by someone’s bed. His words caused a pit in my stomach. He said ‘It looked pretty bad for you, but path. lab. (pathology department) says it’s O K - you can go home today.’ At that moment I had a glimpse into the future and was flooded by unspoken fears. However I pushed down what he had said back into the deepest layers of my unconscious and ‘forgot’ it.I was discharged that day and returned three days later to have the stitches taken out (as an out-patient). The nurse was gentle and didn’t hurt me at all. She and I were both pleased at the neatness of the stitches which ensured that no scar would spoil my beauty! I went home and took up life as usual. I remember that I even scrubbed the kitchen floor that day. I didn’t feel too great. My arm was aching but I was so relieved to be home and to be in a warm bed with my boyfriend again after the chilly isolation of hospital. The next day we invited some friends round for a meal to celebrate my triumphant return. I cooked chicken and pineapple I remember and I was just about to take it in to serve it when a knock came on the door. To my indescribable shock I found my husband standing there. (I hadn’t seen him for almost a year.) He told me that the hospital had rung him, and asked him to take me there the following morning. The biopsy report had been ‘wrong’. (Needless to say when I went into the hospital I had filled in all my details in triplicate, was accompanied by my boyfriend, etc. The administration had got hold of my old admission card and rung a number eighteen months out of date.) I burst into tears, I got rid of him, shut the door, went back upstairs and somehow in a daze we served and ate the meal I’d prepared. The night was endless. I lay in my boyfriend’s arms and cried. We tried to comfort each other but it was difficult. In the morning we got up and went together to the hospital.When we arrived the sister of the ward was expecting us and we were hurried into a private ward off the main ward where she explained that there was a ‘mistake’ and they now ‘wanted to take a bit more tissue away’. Several kind and sympathetic nurses came in and out during the next thirty minutes or so as we waited for the consultant to make his round, bringing paper handkerchiefs to mop up my tears, coffee and tranquillizers. I was totally unable to talk or communicate with anybody. I felt only that I was in a nightmare, perhaps under an anaesthetic still in the first operation and soon someone would wake me up and it would all be unreal. (I still have this feeling occasionally and I have to touch myself to check that my breast really isn’t there any more.) As we waited I stared out over a filthy courtyard with a fire escape thinking how it symbolized everything about our society. I felt trapped. I wanted to run from the hospital. I drew on the dirty pane of the window with my finger ‘This is the way the world ends - not with a bang but a whimper.’ The great man finally arrived. It seemed hour that we had waited in silence though it was probably only a short time. What followed were the most terrible, endless minutes of my life.I’ll just report it as it felt. My boyfriend was sent out of the room (Why?) and I was left with the sister although my memory is that I was alone. Perhaps this is because I felt alone. The consultant had with him around eight white-coated male acolytes. The room seemed to be filled with them. I sat sobbing uncontrollably as he told me he would like to amputate the breast and give me a ‘normal life’. I could have an ‘appliance’. He told me that there was no other form of treatment. All that I was aware of during this speech was my complete humiliation as woman under those seemingly dispassionate many pairs of masculine eyes seeing me as ‘woman, twenty-eight, carcinogenic’, disassociating me from their reactions to women as people, or even women as desirable, warm and human. After the speech was over I stuttered out between sobs chat I would not have the operation as I could not bear to be mutilated in that way. He did not argue much but told me that he hoped I would change my mind. Outside the door the Australian houseman (who presumably was responsible for what had happened since he gave me the wrong biopsy report) said to the ward Sister ‘Why do you British women make such a fuss about a non-functional organ? Women don’t behave like that in Australia.’Needless to say I was persuaded by the nurses, the sister and the other women in the ward to think again and I went into the operating theatre again as the first patient the following morning. I was offered a private ward but chose to go back into the public ward as I valued the support and companionship of other women. The nursing staff helped me a great deal by their sympathy, and by letting me ‘talk it out’ over several days. The male doctors were brisk and impersonal. There was no psychological follow up on a formal level whatever, either after the operation or on discharge. I find the period around the actual operation difficult to remember. I was very heavily drugged for days afterwards until I asked them to reduce the dose as I felt tired and muddled all the time. I was only in hospital for ten days during which time the stitches were removed, and a bottle taken away which had drained off excess fluid. I didn’t suffer any loss of arm functions, just a little stiffness. I felt quite weak for a few weeks (not surprising having had two anaesthetics in such a short period). The psychological effects are much more difficult to cope with and still persist to a greater or lesser extent.It is very hard to be a woman with a scar instead of a breast in a society where everywhere you look there are pictures of idealized, beautiful and well-developed bodies. It is very hard not to feel put down and ugly and undesirable. I am very lucky in that I have a loving relationship but even so I found it difficult to adjust and to feel relaxed again without clothes on even when alone. I still feel uneasily that somehow it is a punishment for my sexuality and pride in my body in that period before the operation - that short guilt-free interlude. The prosthesis (false breast) provided on the N H S is relatively good – air ­ and fluid-filled plastic (some hospitals still don’t provide these - Northampton Hospital for example gives out such antiquated old-type prostheses that women buy their own if they can afford it). I received no follow-up advice on then N H S other than a physical check-up every three months and examination for secondary growths. I found out where to buy special swimwear (made by a mastectomy patient) by reading the Sunday Times. Since I had the operation I have given birth to a daughter after a normal pregnancy. In spite of the fact that I couldn’t breast feed, and they knew why, health visitors, relaxation instructors were all pleased to point out the disadvantages of bottle feeding - including the prevalence of cot deaths. Etc.I would therefore end this article by commenting that the lack of concern for and sensitivity towards women in this situation is a result of the hierarchical and male-dominated structure of medicine. Not only the physical mutilation but the fear of death is something that has to be learnt to be lived with and perhaps groups could be set up for women to support each other in this respect by talking these fears out. The psychological aspect needs a great deal of research particularly in regard to the seeming prevalence of the development of breast cancer after periods of great mental stress. It may be coincidence that three women I know contracted breast cancer after the break up of a marriage, and emotional crisis may play some as yet unknown part in acting as a trigger mechanism in the breakdown of immunological defences. This was suggested to me by a sympathetic male registrar at the Whittington.Much is said about the importance of educating women to seek advice early. I would say from my experience that the medical profession also needs education in this respect and should be discouraged from making dangerous assumptions on the grounds of generalized probabilities. Improving the standard of aftercare is a priority. Mastectomy patients unite - we have nothing to lose but our fears!SR.37, July 1975 

Joan Scott: Living Her DyingANN SCOTTJoan Scott, who reviewed a television play about breast cancer for Spare Rib, died last June. The play had been controversial within the BBC on the question of patients being withheld information, and Joan was one of several women asked to read the script before transmission. ‘I would not only argue,’ she wrote in the magazine, ‘that one has a right to such vital information about one’s own body, but also that one develops strength to face it. To deny a fellow human being the opportunity of finding and working on inner resources is to belittle and underestimate her/him.’With her characteristic sense of purpose she wrote that review during one of many hospitalizations for bone cancer. She sat up with her glasses and her biro, writing and rewriting, asking me to read each draft, angry when the nurses got her painkillers wrong. DF118, Distalgesic, she always knew the names and had preferences.‘It is not enough that when we are having surgery we are suffering and scared. We must also rally our wits and defend ourselves against the consequences of other people’s incompetence, uncaring attitudes, or reluctance to face our needs. When we can get out we can start/resume agitating for a better health service; but while “in”, if we want to take responsibility for “our bodies, ourselves”, we can’t afford to be passive.’That familiar slogan, originally the title of a North American book about women’s health, had a particular meaning for Joan. She was in her late fifties when she got involved in women’s liberation, a couple of years after her marriage ended. She was sixty-two when she died; and that meant childhood after the First World War, adolescence before the Pill or any ideology of sexual emancipation.In an essay written for a Workers’ Educational Association summer school four years ago, Joan described ‘Three Generations of Women’ her mother’s, her own and her two daughters’. ‘There had been a son before me, but he had died. Three more daughters were born in an effort to replace him, and a family legend, no doubt founded on fact, is that the doctor (also a friend) reproached my father when delivering the youngest: my mother was over forty by then. Of course he had never been able to give them any contraceptive advice: in those days, at any rate in Guernsey, it was abstinence or nothing.’Joan’s subsequent experience of a marriage in which domesticity was the only socially acknowledged role for women like her - educated women, genteel women who might go to the theatre - made women’s liberation an imperative. Silenced by the demands of her class and sex, she had lived as a competent housewife. ‘I put up with the usual domestic oppression, blaming myself for resenting it. When my first child was born I gave up paid work and became a captive wife and mother. I knew it was foolish, and resolved that next time I would go out to work and pay someone to look after the baby. But when the younger one was born I had so internalized the maternal duty that I could not bring myself to hand her over to a stranger, and stayed where I was.’ She did volunteer work for the Family Planning Association, entertained neighbours and her husband’s friends. Never showing anger. Rarely laughing. Rarely time to read.She had been active in the pacifist, almost conventionally feminine setting of the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom. It was when she began living on her own that she felt a need to act fast. ‘I must look for an outfit working to change the society,’ she wrote me in 1971. She would look for women’s liberation and socialist groups ‘as near home as possible, and latch on to them’, urging me, too, to ‘develop some empathy towards a woman who is only now, in middle age, struggling to be liberated’.She stopped wearing her wedding ring, she bought her clothes in boutiques, went to women’s conferences. ‘The Anti-Discrimination Bill comes up in the House of Commons tomorrow evening and once more we rally to the lobby,’ she wrote early in 1973, ending with the casual postscript: ‘Now I’m going to do about a fortnight’s dishes.’ But she was conscious of her age and full of doubt about her worth; she was glad when the women’s group met at her flat, for touches like this made her feel accepted. Feminism came to have a real relationship to everyday experience: she had some people to dinner; the men talked, the women fell silent. I was much more critical of the men than Joan was, and she wrote to me the following week: ‘I have thought a good deal, intermittently, about the dinner party... Your observations on it have made me aware that I can and should do something, even in what appears to be a minor and purely superficial setting, to bolster my sisters’ egos and raise the consciousness both of them and of their men.’Not everything could change, and I think there was always a tension between the demands of her generation and those of the movement. She had learned to be polite, and caring, and discreet; to gauge her meaning as a person by her success as a woman. Irony was possible; convalescing after her mastectomy she wrote: ‘Today we have had fun watching the Queen’s [wedding] anniversary celebrations and toasting her in vodka and orange juice, wondering how many other middle-aged women whose marriages had gone awry were doing exactly the same thing!... From which you will see that I am coming back to life.’ And shortly before her bone cancer developed, she laughed when she described her fantasy of opening an F P A sex education seminar with ‘Well. One of my daughters is a lesbian and the other’s an unsupported mother.’ She was discovering defiance.But there was always a poignancy to her freedom. However much she knew that her needs had been shaped by the culture (‘I was thankful to be married - to “fail” to “get” a husband would have been intolerable’), she had been a wife and mother far too long to discard that culture without unease. If she rejected femininity, wasn’t she also rejecting years of her own experience, of her sense of herself? In Joni Mitchell she found a singer who spoke to her condition, but inspired her to go on letting go:Papa’s faith is peopleMama she believes in cleaningPapa’s faith is in peopleMama she’s always cleaningMama thinks she spoils mePapa knows somehow he set me freeMama thinks she spoilt me rottenShe blames herselfBut Papa he blesses meIt’s a rough road to travelMama let go nowIt’s always called for meThe sadness of Joan’s cancer was that it interrupted the delicacy of that transition. Letting go became more and more difficult as illness undermined her independence. To find her own autonomy, then, to be her own person, she took responsibility for her body. She fought for control in the only territory that was open to her: her relationship to her illness, her hospital’s relationship to her.It was a very definite fight. ‘I had to make clear that I was determined to know everything,’ she wrote in reply to Gill Loveday’s ‘Facing up to death’, a letter in Spare Rib, ‘and that I wanted my daughters to know too. They were interviewed separately [by her doctor and social worker] and since then there are no secrets.’ Access to information gave her a way of affirming herself within rather than against her cancer; it was her only defence against the bitterness and humiliation of dependence. She experienced the loss of self-esteem that goes with eating from a feeding bowl with a spout because she had to lie flat on her back for a week. She wished she could walk to X-ray: it felt ‘psychologically damaging’ to go on a stretcher day after day. She was often too depressed to talk, let alone to cry.Six weeks later she had learned to walk, first with a frame, then with a stick. She felt there was a bit of a future, the possibility of pleasure. ‘It’s bone cancer now,’ she wrote to her sister-in-law in Vienna, ‘and yet, strangely, if one must have cancer, there’s something to be said for this brand. Soft tissues rotting mean surgery, whereas I’m treated with radiation and hormones, and the race is on between the disease and the steroids that are being packed into my bones to strengthen them... I’m resigned to having no long term - perhaps a couple of years – but I’m just speculating. The excellent people here can’t commit themselves. As Dr Johnson said, it [the prospect of death] concentrates the mind wonderfully.’Leaving the hospital was quite hard. ‘I felt so odd driving away,’ she told me the day after her discharge. She had been in for two months. ‘I knew the nurses would set to, scrubbing my room - they’d soon forget me - and somehow I had to live in the real world.’ That determination gave way to despair, anger and loneliness. Joan had deposits at the base of her spine and couldn’t bend. She couldn’t stand or walk for more than a few minutes. Cooking and cleaning were impossible. She hadn’t the strength to go in to work more than two or three mornings a week. ‘How I wish I could help you,’ her letter to Gill Loveday continues, ‘but how right you are when you say what a debilitating disease cancer is and how one’s own need is for support from others, there’s no surplus energy to give. I live on a razor’s edge, trying not to conceal this from family and friends, and yet at the same time trying not to be a drag on them and make them feel that I’m a hardly bearable burden.’ The sense of that razor’s edge is explicit in two descriptions of the same week. To her sister-in-law she writes: ‘I have had to devise occupational therapy for myself - I now knit, I who was utterly handless, because I was almost literally twitching as I sat listening to the radio or “relaxing” in some other passive way... So you can picture me sitting like a Madame Defarge, feverishly clicking away with big needles.’ My own account is rather different. ‘My mother knits long scarves as therapy. Fingers shaking, sits watching TV programmes she’s not interested in. Is irritated by her listlessness, is pernickety and fastidious, has no pain, wonders whether she’d be better dead. And we have cathartic talks where we cry and hold hands.’The loss of energy - ‘I haven’t the physical or psychic energy to initiate anything’ - contained an ambiguity for Joan. It was a release from trivia - at times of relative calm she would remind herself of Dr Johnson - and an opportunity to discover what really mattered: to talk to friends, to read when her concentration allowed it, to be active where it was physically possible. Three weeks before her death she was planning to go to the London Region women’s liberation conference; had she gone it would have been her first excursion in three months.But that loss also meant abdicating her ability to control her environment. Her women’s group organized a rota, ‘so that there is always someone at the end of the telephone ready to come, do anything, spend the night, simply provide moral support- or drive me somewhere if I need to go.’ And yet it was very hard for her to acknowledge the extent of her needs: ‘To have to be on the receiving end all the time isn’t always easy after learning to be independent.’ At times when I would have liked to sit and talk she would force herself to put the dishes away. It was a way of establishing herself as competent. But living on her own had to change, and a friend of mine suggested that Joan have her own flat in the house we were going to buy. We asked her what she thought of this and she burst into tears. But that same day she talked about a holiday in Italy a few years before; she could link her past with a possible future.It was when the illness was weakening her and she became susceptible to infections like pleurisy that Joan began to talk more about dying. She was in hospital last March; I remember her floral nightie and an angora shawl. She was writing in her notebook when I went in. She lay musing for a while. She had been thinking about a memorial meeting for herself.She mentioned the song ‘Bread and Roses’ and a poem of my sister’s. She wanted statements to be made about her work in the Family Planning Association and the women’s movement. She moved her hands a little, stared ahead of her. ‘And there are some lines from Keats’s “Ode to a Nightingale”,’ she began, ‘though lots of it isn’t relevant, of course... “To cease upon the midnight with no pain”...’ And then, faltering: ‘“I have been half in love with easeful death”...’We cried for a while. Then we laughed when I teased her for deciding what people would say about her in advance. She wanted to give her body to a medical school and enquired placidly about the students’ work: did they need both breasts? I mentioned the dissection room in Cambridge where I had begun to study medicine. No, you often saw bodies where surgery had been done. She nodded. Thinking all the time.Darkling I listen; and for many a timeI have been half in love with easeful Death, Called him soft names in many a mused rhyme,To take into the air my quiet breath;Now more than ever seems it rich to die,To cease upon the midnight with no pain,While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroadIn such an ecstasy!That deep sadness, that recognition of loss could find expression only in metaphor. By remembering the poem Joan was able to externalize her fear, to find acceptance of her death in a kind of magic outside herself. But those meetings of ours had to be ephemeral, almost invisible. The acknowledgement of imminent severance created the very intimacy that would have to be loosened if her death wasn’t to become a struggle against itself.A month later Joan was barely able to move. She was losing her resilience, feeling sick from the painkillers. ‘I don’t know how much longer I can go on being ill like this... I don’t know how much the human frame can take.’ I helped her to get undressed. There were her bruised arms, her scar, the pain on moving, the nervousness when she cleaned her face, the anxiety when she looked in the mirror. She started to cry. ‘It’s so hard for you,’ I said. ‘For you, too,’ she replied. ‘Why for me?’ She sobbed louder - at first her words were indistinct, and then: ‘It’s so hard for you to see me like this.’ She looked at me, as though she were terribly ashamed of herself. And then I understood how hard it was for a mother to be a child, to let her daughter look after her, and how hard Joan had battled to let me go.She still planned to go to Vienna for a fortnight. Her doctor told her that if she felt as weak when she came back, she should come straight into hospital. She spent that time in Vienna in bed and went into hospital the day after her return, too tired to talk. But a couple of days later she was cheerful again: she’d been told she’d had a mild viral hepatitis. A tangible illness, it seemed to explain everything - the loss of appetite, the depression, the loss of weight.In fact Joan was dying. The cancer had spread to her liver, and as her next of kin I had been told. It was a real betrayal. Had they forgotten that she was ‘determined to know everything’? By deceiving Joan they were denying her right to live her own dying.A hospital will tend to deny the reality of death and dying so long as medicine’s social role is defined as one of curing disease. ‘The current culture of the hospital, which emphasizes the disease process and the diseased organ, is counterproductive to the needs of the dying patient.’3 In the work of dying4 there is no need for the very resources - technical knowledge, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures - which legitimate medicine’s control of physical experience. The dying patient, then, represents a particular kind of threat.The medical management of death itself creates estrangement. ‘The patient’s alienation from his own body is increased at just the time when it needs to be broken down: since medicine defines dying as a doctor’s failure, not a patient’s task, the dying person is prevented from accepting death and allying himself with it,’ David Ingleby wrote.5 ‘As in childbirth, mind and body are disconnected by drugs, machines and social pressure... and as in childbirth, nothing could guarantee a worse outcome: only those who can let themselves go with the natural process of dying are able to find in death a completion of life.’But a denial of death also undermines the kind of therapeutic communication that can go on between people when both know that one of them is dying. When the patient is ready to accept the reality of dying, those around her must show they are ready to share her acceptance. But the dying person’s acceptance exists alongside envy and resentment towards those who will go on living, however much support they have given; there is also guilt at ‘leaving people behind’. Nor does acceptance cut out fear. What matters is that communication be allowed to go on; that the dying person experience that ambiguity, that it be acknowledged as real; that the feelings related to death be accepted.Joan herself understood this. ‘One is overwhelmed with sorrow for Simone’s mother,’ she had written me five years before, after reading de Beauvoir’s A Very Easy Death, ‘and at the same time one enters utterly into Simone’s conflict of feeling, so lucidly expressed, between suffering and the detachment that the living must feel for the dying. And an added pang for me, as perhaps you can imagine - twenty years on, will it be you and Miriam and me?’There was a great deal of conflict over the handling of Joan’s last illness. The hospital staff kept saying different things. Her doctor: ‘It’s the disease, you see. Patients do change. I see a lot of patients who say they want to be told everything; and they don’t.’ Her social worker: ‘I’ve never lied to my patients and I’m not going to start now.’ Her ward sister: ‘She’s so calm now. It would be a tragedy to make her distressed.’ And in the middle of it all was Joan herself, irritated that the nurses kept measuring her fluid intake, but confused by her own behaviour: sometimes relaxing with The Times, sometimes dissolving in tears. She rang me one morning: ‘Oh... I feel so limp; I can hardly rise from my chair - the nurses keep telling me I’m doing very well... but I wonder whether they say that to everybody...’I was very angry. I asked to see the medical team together- consultant, senior house officer, house physician, social worker - to discuss Joan’s rights in the situation. How much did they think she knew? What did they think she thought they knew? What would her needs be? How could we co-operate better in meeting them? What was the physiology of dying? We went through the ways in which I felt she was being deceived. Her consultant asked me whether I’d thought of the possibility that she herself knew she was dying, but wasn’t yet ready to communicate it. ‘She isn’t asking us any questions about her illness, you see,’ he said, ‘and she always has- always.’ No, she wasn’t on the sort of euphoriant dose that would confuse her. I began to see that I had to show her I could let her die.6 ‘If she asks you a question that you don’t feel you can answer, come and ask us to help you.’ Apparently it was the first time a relative had challenged the department like this.7A couple of days later, then, I took her a volume of Keats’s poems. Joan looked at it, sighed, and began to cry. I asked her what she was thinking about. ‘The process of dying... is this it?’ she whispered. ‘Is it here one minute and gone the next?’ I asked her what kinds of anxieties she had about dying; she hesitated - stayed silent.‘You might think I’d be too frightened to talk about it,’ I said. ‘But I’m not.’ It seemed to reassure her; then I said, ‘Do you have other anxieties?’‘Yes.’ But she couldn’t say them.‘That you’d be on your own?’ She nodded, closing her eyes.‘But you won’t... because I’ll stay with you.’She looked at me, smiled, held my hand; there was the relief of openness but an agitation too. She said she was scared that she wouldn’t be able to breathe. I suggested she talk to her doctor the following morning.When I saw her the next afternoon, she was much weaker but seemed less anxious, almost unselfconscious. She told me she’d had ‘a good long talk’ with her doctor, but then she started to drift. ‘People keep asking me what my feelings are... I wish I wasn’t the focus of people’s attention... I just want to be left alone.’8 Joan was separating herself now, and she died the following day.‘An added pang for me,’ she had written five years before. ‘I want to concentrate on the main impression [de Beauvoir] has made on me - that when one is in one’s terminal illness it is too late to talk about one’s feelings, past and actual - one is simply too tired to bother... one is sunk fathoms deep in self-absorption - it takes a long time “to come to the surface of one’s eyes” - as Simone describes her mother doing, and see the people around, who once were all-important to one.’The night before she died the woman who had suggested she live with us came to see her. ‘Cathy’s here. Will you see her?’ Joan smiled with great joy. Cathy came behind the curtains. There was a scent of summer flowers, a feeling of peace. Joan lay her arm on the table; it was a languid gesture - her death was very close, for her body was getting colder. She tilted her head to one side - said Cathy’s name ­ looked up - and towards Cathy again; and that moment, which was one of the sweetest, was soon gone, for Joan was weary. Too weary, as well, to say more, to respond or withdraw. Limbs thin with cancer have a quietness which can be calming.We held her memorial meeting on Midsummer’s Day. Of the letters that I got afterwards, one caught its meaning exactly. ‘I was especially glad that you talked about Joan’s feelings about having such an illness and preparing for death. Like most other people I find it all very frightening, and it is a great help forward to hear people who have been very close to the experience being able to talk about it... as you did. I suppose that is what I meant by consciousness raising, because it is in an ever-present way a component of so much of my thinking - that hope and desire that when it comes one may be able to die among friends and struggle through to an acceptance of what is happening. So though perhaps it is paradoxical, I had a lovely time.’A month after she died I was looking through Joan’s copy of Away with All Pests, Joshua Horn’s account of his work as a surgeon in People’s China. The custom of holding memorial meetings for rank and file comrades who die while serving the revolution, Horn wrote, started in Yenan in 1944 when Mao Tse-tung made a speech at the funeral of a charcoal burner named Chang Szu-teh. Memorial meetings should be held so that what was worthy of study could be brought out and placed before the people and so that they could express their love, their gratitude and their sorrow. ‘In his speech Mao quoted a Chinese historian who, two thousand years before, had written: “Though Death befalls all men alike, it may be weightier than Mount Tai or lighter than a feather.” He said that the death of anyone who had truly served the people was weightier than Mount Tai.’ Joan had underlined those words.The title of this piece comes from Living Your Dying by Stanley Keleman, an American bio-energetics therapist (Random House, 1975). Joan’s review of Through the Night appeared in Spare Rib No. 45, April 1976.SR.57, April 1977 
10	VIOLENCENew ideas about womanhood question old assumptions about manhood. Once women challenge their subordinate relation to men, they dissolve the notion that a harmony exists between the two sexes who occupy separate but complementary spheres. The opposition and hostility underlying the relationship of domination and submission between men and women is then revealed.Both women and men can have equally violent emotions but ‘masculinity’ makes it legitimate for men to express aggression outwardly, while ‘femininity’ does the opposite for women. Women frequently turn their anger and aggression against themselves, expressing these feelings as self-hate, fear, guilt or depression. Male violence against women takes forms of sexual harassment, rape, physical assault and battering. It is both public and private. It expresses contempt for women as the subjugated sex.The public violence of pornography has become more respectable because it now appears in all media, including women’s magazines. Thus the representation of women as submissive has escalated. By intruding more into daily life it reinforces the idea that women are vulnerable, need male protection, and desire to be overpowered.Because the family is the centre of personal relationships, the frustration and distress of economic hardship and emotional strain from the world outside the home can be unleashed inside its privacy. During the firemen’s strike, Jennifer Duggan, one of the firemen’s wives who demonstrated in support of their husbands, talked about the effect of her husband’s work: ‘I can’t talk to my husband when he gets in - the job makes him so tense and ill. When I tell him his dinner’s in the oven or something, he often just tells me to shut up’ (SR.66). Violence under stress is seen as men’s birthright. For women who work a ninety-hour week at home and outside, retaliation is forbidden.But now we are fighting back. Starting with lessons in self-defence, the women’s liberation movement has gone on to set up Rape Crisis and Women’s Aid centres. Their way of organizing allows women independence in deciding about the future, whether a married woman wants to leave her husband or a raped woman will choose to prosecute the man. They aim to help women overcome the sense of themselves as victims. Women are often made to feel that they bring violence on themselves, that they ‘ask for it’, or even enjoy it. They need, therefore, to share their sense of shame and suffering in order not to be trapped by guilt. The centres offer the protection which can sustain women through the process of recovery and the means to transform a self-destructive response into self-renewal.Police in Spare Rib No. 77 said that reported rape incidents were twice that of the previous year, and that ‘now they get one rape every thirty hours and four indecent assaults a day’. Violence as a form of social control by men over women is reflected in misogynist police and judicial procedures. In 1976 the Sex Offences (Amendment) Act allowed raped women anonymity. But rape is still legally defined as vaginal penetration although it often entails worse physical mutilation and damage; it is usually a premeditated crime and is primarily an act of aggression rather than the release of sexual frustration.Sexism and racism are connected. When Judge Sutcliffe presided over a trial of five Moroccan teenagers who raped a girl in London, his ‘chivalry’ disguised male property rights over women, and cloaked his racism. Victoria Green wrote that the media attitude was ‘righteous fury characterized the criticism of the [light] sentences: “Our women are being ravaged”’ (SR.53).Racist attacks by white youths and men on Black women (as well as on Black men) are on the increase but are often not publicized. Whereas when Black people retaliate or organize for their own safety and protection, they encounter suspicion and hostility.Sex education needs to change so that boys see through the social myths about sexuality. And, on a private level, men need to scrutinize the violent feelings they harbour against women - such as those discovered by one of the men’s groups formed in response to feminism, ‘Fears of being devoured, possessed, weakened or contaminated by women suddenly poured out of a lot of men’ (SR.10). 
Leeds: Curfew on MenEILEEN FAIRWEATHERScarcely a day goes by without women in the North of England being reminded of the existence of the man police call the Yorkshire Ripper; ‘All women are now at risk’ is a fairly typical headline. In the past three and a half years the Ripper has murdered eleven women - seven of them in Leeds- and attempted to kill four others. Vicars’ prayers for the victims are reported in the press; the public conscience appears outraged.Or is it? Read beneath the headlines and you find comments like ‘even prostitutes don’t deserve to die like this’. And the Yorkshire and Evening Post (who have jointly offered a reward of £5,000 for information leading to the Ripper’s arrest) have yet to mention that the Ripper killings are, as feminists in Leeds point out, only ‘at the extreme end of the scale of the violence women face every day; from being touched up in the street at the “frivolous” end of it, through to battering and rape.’ In the flood of Ripper publicity, this connection is rarely if ever made.Instead the press, both locally and nationally, has focused attention on the ‘virtue’ of the victims. This also, of course, routinely happens in rape cases. In this way, attention is drawn away from who is to blame for these attacks; men, not women. Nine of the Ripper’s eleven victims have, in fact, been prostitute women. Or, as the Daily Mirror chose to describe them, ‘good-time girls offering sex for sale’. Jane McDonald, by contrast, was described as ‘an innocent sixteen-year-old shop assistant’ and, when Josephine Whittaker was murdered this April, the West Yorkshire Assistant Chief Constable explained how ‘It would look as if in this case, as with Miss McDonald, he [the Ripper] made a mistake. Miss Whittaker, a building society clerk, was a perfectly respectable girl.’ The implication is that the other women who were also sexually mutilated and murdered somehow ‘asked’ for it ­ they were non-innocent, non-respectable.Magda, of the Leeds Rape Crisis Centre, did not consider the Ripper had killed the non-prostitute women ‘by mistake’: ‘When you hate women as much as he must, any woman will do. Prostitutes are simply more vulnerable targets.’ She also felt that the enormous publicity given to the women’s prostitution had probably hindered catching the Ripper: ‘Hundreds of people have phoned with information about the women who weren’t prostitutes, but the police themselves say they have had very few offers of information with the other women. The attitude seems to be that prostitutes just don’t matter.’The Yorkshire press and police feel they have proved their concern for ‘ordinary’ women by constantly warning them to stay indoors after dark. Whether it is the Ripper murders or the ‘normal’ rapes which take place every night throughout Britain, it is men who are violent yet women who are expected to take responsibility for this, by accepting an unofficial curfew on the times they may safely walk the streets. Apart from the fact that women want the right to move freely, many have no choice about being out late. The women at the Evening Post who deal with the adverts for the Rape Crisis Centre, and who work for a paper which is instructing women to be indoors by nine o’clock, themselves finish work at 9.30...SR.83, June 1979       Sian Thomas, SR.74, September 1978
‘He’s Got to Show Her Who’s Boss’NATIONAL WOMEN’S AID FEDERATIOMrs X was kicked downstairs.Miss B’s ‘husband’ switched off the heating and locked away the food whenever he left the house.Miss C was kept short of money.Mrs A’s husband forced her to have sex with his friends.These women are being battered and come to Women’s Aid refuges. The battering they receive within their particular relationships is an extreme form of the bartering we all receive as women in this society.Because battering has only recently become ‘An Issue For Public Concern’, people are trying to find ways of understanding it which fit in with traditional ways of seeing and treating women, whilst ignoring the unequal nature of the society in which it takes place.‘She must have done something to deserve it.’‘She must enjoy it although he probably goes a bit far sometimes.’ ‘It’s a man’s right to keep her in her place - he’s got to show her who’s boss.’‘Only working-class women get battered - it’s part of their way of life.’‘All batteries must be mental or alcoholics.’These are all common reactions to women who are being beaten or mistreated, both from people who haven’t really thought about it and from those who have done ‘research’ into the ‘problem’.... About seven years ago women’s liberation groups all over Britain, who had been discussing the different ways women are oppressed, began to realize that women were suffering at the hands of the men they were living with. The most immediate need of women who were being mentally and physically battered was for somewhere safe to stay away from their men so that they could think about what to do.The first refuge, in Chiswick, has stayed outside the Federation, as have others set up by social services. They don’t see battering as a women’s liberation issue, nor do they recognize its relationship to the general oppression of women. Instead they think that individual family circumstances cause battering and therefore that members of the family have to be treated.Feminists wanted to set up refuges in a way that didn’t limit and oppress the women who came to them. Once these refuges opened, two general rules were developed from the ideas and experience of women involved. The first is that any woman who asks for refuge should be immediately accepted. She should not be asked to prove she is battered - or battered ‘badly enough’ or without ‘cause’. To be able to do this the Federation operates a national open door policy - if one refuge is overcrowded a place will be found in another refuge.The other ‘rule’ is that women have the right to self-determination. This means that it is the women living in the refuge who run it with help from the support group - a group of people committed to keeping the refuge going and offering support to the women in the house. We don’t have wardens and those of us in support groups try not to act as informal wardens.       Christine Roche, SR.91, February 1980Both these rules bring difficulties as well as advantages. They sometimes clash. When a group of women has been in a refuge a while they tend to forget the desperation they felt when they first phoned for help. They are also under the emotional strain of living in a nearly always overcrowded house, as well as having to make major decisions about their future. So when a woman rings up asking for refuge they may resent having yet another person to deal with. As it is the women who decide who comes into the house, they might sometime refuse refuge when they could make room.Most groups have at some time experienced this clash between the principle of self-determination and that of the open door policy. The only effective way of dealing with it is by working it out with the women in the house. It solves nothing in the long term for the support group to take over admissions.Refuges are generally less tidy and clinically clean than hostels, which can cause friction amongst the women because everyone has different ways of living. But in coming to an agreement about such things a lot is learnt about living with other people and about developing ways of living which are practical and fit in with our own ideas of how we want to live; we can stop failing to live up to someone else’s image of the perfect housewife.Any group-living situation brings problems and this is especially true in a refuge where the women haven’t chosen to live together. But in spite of this women living in a refuge give and gain a lot. They have all had similar and horrific experiences which many have never before been able to share with anyone, and they face the same difficulties in the refuge, with the children and in dealing with Social Security, social workers and so on. Links formed in this way are often strong and supportive and sometimes friendships carry on after women have left the refuge. This would probably happen more if they didn’t have to cope with being a single parent or being rehoused in different areas of town.... As a Federation we contain different political views. When women in refuges begin to take part in the work of the Federation they obviously bring to it their own understanding of the world, as do people in support groups. This means there is much heated discussion, with groups and individuals continually learning from each other. But the general outlook is feminist and against capitalism.Obviously as a national organization we have to work at various levels local, regional and national, but our strength is local and regional. Everybody in Women’s Aid - workers in the national office, women in refuges and support group members - is involved to some degree in their local group, and all national decisions are taken by voluntary representatives of local groups and the regions. We want the structure to be flexible, open to any woman wanting to take part, and the work and information to be shared widely.In practice women in refuges are less involved in the campaigning and co-ordinating side of Women’s Aid at regional and national levels. There are two main reasons for this. Firstly women come to refuges because they need to and generally stay for a short time, whereas women in support groups and paid workers have chosen to make a commitment to Women’s Aid and are likely to get involved for longer. It is always difficult for new women to get involved in an established group where other women have more knowledge and experience. The other reason is that most women in support groups and most paid workers are middle class and women who come to refuges tend to be working class. (We are using the terms middle class and working class to describe different experiences and don’t see one as better than the other.)Working-class women are more likely to come to refuges because they have less access to money, other accommodation and information about the law and so are in greater need of practical help. Middle-class women often live in more self-contained homes where battering is more hidden and it is harder for these women to admit they are battered. And if middle-class women leave home they have more to lose in terms of money, status and a financially secure future for their children.Some Women’s Aid groups were started by women involved in the women’s liberation movement, which tended to attract mainly middle­class women, without appearing to offer much that related to working­class women’s experience. Others were started either by social services, or by middle-class women with the ‘helping attitude’ which is a sort of tradition among them. Some groups which didn’t start with feminist ideas but were prepared to accept the aims of the Federation, are affiliated. None of the social sciences’ refuges are. Most affiliated groups contain different attitudes which are changing with experience. As a Federation we are working towards a more feminist approach and at our last conference we included the six demands of the women’s liberation movement in the guidelines to our aims. There is ever­increasing discussion of feminist ideas in Women’s Aid.More women who are or have been in refuges are now involved in local groups but their involvement at other levels of the Federation is very low. Language is a major reason for this; middle-class women tend to use academic language, long words as a sort of shorthand for whole ideas (for example - ‘agenda’ instead of ‘list of things to be discussed’). This puts off women not used to this way of talking.The same problems apply to the structures we use. In January we held a conference to discuss the structure of conferences and of the Federation as a whole. There was a workshop just for women who were or had been in refuges, so that middle-class women would not inhibit them with their relative confidence and language, which stop working-class women getting what they want from conferences. Women from this workshop got very angry and challenged the general running of the Federation, and many things done unthinkingly which put women down, and which are the hardest to tackle. There was also a strong feeling that Women’s Aid should be working towards being an organization for battered women, composed solely of women who are or have been in refuges. Women from refuges felt there should be similar workshops at the next national conference.As well as seeing class as an important issue, we, as members of support groups, are also becoming more aware of ageism - the problems of older and much younger women - of racism and of sexuality. We are tentative about tackling these issues because we are frightened of our own unthought-out prejudices and of being patronizing. We might feel we have to set up something - a project or campaign - for women who are not ‘young’, middle class and white and make sure this succeeds ­ by our own ‘young’ middle-class white values! Our own fear of failure - from years of learning that women aren’t meant to succeed - makes us fear for others. In trying to protect other women from repeating our mistakes we also stop them learning from their own experience.Class is an issue in the whole women’s liberation movement. As more working-class women get involved, established ideas and practices are challenged. Hopefully this will produce a feminism which will make sense to all women.As well as the contradictions we face within the Federation, we have to deal with many outside bodies; this is the hardest area of work to resolve because we have so little control. Local groups receive grants from different sources - Urban Aid, Job Creation, direct grants from social services and recently under the new Housing Act, as well as rent income from the Department of Health and Social Security. We rent houses from local authorities. Because we depend on local government for money and houses they have some control over us, although we are not usually seen as important enough for them to bother too much. But when they do, there are many legal ways for them to affect the way Women’s Aid groups work or stop them working altogether. This happened in Bradford recently when the local authority made it impossible for Bradford Women’s Aid to run the house, and effectively deprived them of their government grant (which the local authority controlled). Groups are aware of the pressure to compromise and have to continually discuss this and decide where to draw the lines.We don’t like being answerable to anyone outside Women’s Aid, but if we don’t accept government money, we will continue to exploit women as they have always been exploited doing voluntary work. Often groups with no official funding still have to be careful as they then depend on fund raising, and can easily lose their sources if they are seen as too ‘extreme’.Social workers often try to use refuges as ‘dumping grounds’ for women who slip between other more regulated institutions. We realize that all women are bartered by society and that these women need our support and yet our resources won’t stretch to support all women.Legislation brings conflicts too we can campaign for laws which will bring small but immediate relief to some women but don’t change the real situation of all women. Or we can say that the work this involves isn’t worth the small benefit it brings. Because we are dealing with people’s lives, and a process of change, we have to use the means available to us now to work towards long-term aims. The Domestic Violence Act was welcomed as a solution to the legal problems facing battered women and some still see it as this. In fact it has brought few benefits but its failings can be used to raise consciousness about the needs of battered women and attitude to women in general. The limitations of the new Housing (Homeless Persons) Act can be used to expose the extent of homelessness and show how little is being done about it.Women’s Aid is sometimes dismissed by feminists not involved because of the compromises we have to make. One reason for this is the way we are presented in the press. For example, however much we stress that we work collectively the press still insists on using names and titles - ‘Miss X, leading committee member of the National Women’s Aid Federation...’ Also, there are groups which call themselves Women’s Aid but are not part of the Federation. The publicity these groups get affects the way we are all seen. ‘Don’t believe all you read in the press’ is obviously true, yet feminists don’t seem to apply it to Women’s Aid.Some feminists also see Women’s Aid as do-gooding social work on the cheap. Rape has been taken up as a ‘real’ feminist issue, perhaps because all women know they could be raped. Just as all men are potential rapists, all men are potential batteries. Perhaps feminists relating to ‘nice’, ‘considerate’ men forget that these men have the power to choose not to be so nice.We are aware of the compromises we have to make but also of the real advantages of combining a service with our feminist aims. We try to be a support organization - not where ‘we’ help ‘them’, but where everybody supports and learns from each other. We ask for criticism from feminists outside as well as inside Women’s Aid, but that criticism is only useful if it recognizes the situation we are working in and looks at realistic ways of moving forward.We believe that real revolutionary change must come from a broad base of anger at society and a willingness to change. In Women’s Aid we are reaching women who otherwise would have only the media image of women’s liberation - which is enough to put anyone off! Together we are questioning our lives and the way this society works. Because we are trying to use communal caring ways of living in a competitive society with all the contradictions and confusion that brings, we are forced constantly to question our ideas, to see how they relate to the experience of all women. We mustn’t stand back and say we can’t work in this society so we’ll work on a perfect plan for ‘After the Revolution’. We may get bogged down in the day-to-day practical work, but along with other organizations, like the Rape Crisis Centre and Rights of Women legal collective, we are working to build mass support for feminist ideas and a mass feminist movement to change society.SR.69, April 1978
Three Battered Women Face the FutureSTEPHANIE MARKMAN... The three women share a view of themselves and their futures which is strikingly confident and optimistic. They all emphasize one thing which is hardly ever taken into account in the welter of academic writings on this subject. ‘It needs courage to break away from your home after all these years, especially if you’ve got a family,’ points out Agnes. ‘It takes courage to lift the phone.’ And Jenny says, ‘Women have already had to think for themselves, to even get to a refuge. They’re not helpless, driven, beaten-down women.’And they have developed particular strengths since then. ‘I feel very vulnerable, easily hurt, but also strong,’ says Jenny. ‘I’ve become much stronger, much less conventional, in the sense that I’ve been forced to communicate with women at a very deep level very quickly.’ Chris thinks that she’s changed: ‘I can stand up for myself a lot better. I’m more outspoken than I’ve ever been. I can see different people’s lives more quickly, understand them better. I’ve got more time for people, as well.’For Agnes, ‘the greatest thing is having peace of mind. To put your head on a pillow and know you’re there for the night. To be able to lock your door. It’s not lonely. You know you’re safe. My kids used to be in the street with me at all hours of the night, sleeping under trees, in the park. It’s the greatest thing that can happen to a woman who comes to a refuge, and it costs nothing.’Chris, too, stresses that. ‘I don’t feel lonely. I don’t miss having a man around. I’ve got the peace of mind, not waiting for him to come in drunk, waiting for the key to turn in the lock, not living in fear.’ Jenny speaks also of another kind of freedom: ‘I can do some writing, or real thinking, or reading. I get much more sense of self-value, I rediscover my confidence, I get mental energy. My husband would never let me do anything; he felt threatened. Most of my time was spent getting away from him.’All three women see their future in positive terms. ‘I used to sit and worry about my future, but now I just take the days as they come,’ says Chris. And for Agnes the way forward is simply ‘to go on doing what I’m doing, to help others the way I’ve been helped. I’d like to see all the social workers out and the battered women in. I get the biggest pleasure out of helping the other women.’Jenny, on the point of moving to a far better house next door to her closest friend from the refuge, is particularly optimistic. ‘I feel I’ve come through the worst. I’ve had to learn to cope with problems on my own, I’ve learnt how to deal with my child, with welfare agencies. I know where I’m going and what I want to do. I almost never get depressed.’SR.52, November 1976
Pornography: Between the Devil and the True Blue WhitehouseRUTH WALLSGROVEI find pornography disturbing, chilling - even sometimes physically disgusting. Must I then be a killjoy, a frustrated prude, secretly longing to write articles on porn so that I can sneak a look while publicly rutting?I have been, and am still, confused by the distance between my reactions to pornography and the debates carried out in the press about it. Mary Whitehouse and the Festival of Light seem as opposed to what I want for the world as do pornographers. And liberal men who proclaim that the Sexual Revolution has already occurred, and who contend that not only is porn a necessary expression of freedom of speech, but also that it is part of a new freedom of sex, certainly live in a different world to me. Freedom of speech? - almost anyone can speak in our society, but only those with money and power can make themselves heard. And sex - they all say pornography is to do with sex, but  				Begoma Tamarit, SR.75, October 1978I feel immediately that it has more to do with power and violence. I like to be sexually aroused, but I don’t like pictures of women handcuffed, submissive and inviting the reader to be brutal with them.Pornography presents women as willing victims, as objects to be used, bodies created for the sole purpose of pleasing men. Even when the women in the stories are acting out lesbian or masturbation fantasies there is never any doubt that they are really performing for the reader - a man. And when they ‘speak’ they perpetuate all the old myths of female sexuality. The rough fuck is what they want, none of this boring foreplay or – worse - affection or communication. They are just holes asking to be humiliated and hurt. Magazines present rows and rows of exposed and disembodied vaginas. And this if just soft porn. Sadomasochism and child pornography are becoming ever more common, perhaps because men are becoming satiated with straightforward Page Three of the Sun spreads at the family breakfast table.Men must be pretty sick to enjoy fantasizing about hurting another human being. But perhaps porn is only fantasy; perhaps men do not act on it. Statistical studies do not show a direct link between pornography and rape. Rapists don’t read significantly more porn than do other men, and the incidence of rape seems unaffected by trends in pornography. There is no evidence that porn causes rape directly, and there may be no causal link. But they are linked in spirit. Both are manifestations of the same attitudes towards women and sex - of a desire to avoid interaction with a woman as another human being, to have complete control over sex, at best. At worst, to feel and maintain power oneself by making women powerless. Both are elements of the ideology of the Patriarchy.So does porn matter? Does it have any effect on me, or other women, or girls, that my local newsagent stocks twenty varieties of pornographic magazines, set out in the doorway, with twenty varieties of simpering, undignified nudes in full colour on the covers? Does it make the men who buy them despise women... any more than anything else in our society that degrades women? Pornography can be seen as merely an extension of images of women in adverts, as shiny decorative objects.But adverts themselves become more and more pornographic. Fashion photographers now take classy porn photos, and the seedy, ludicrous publications in backstreets shops are being superceded by glossies that hold press receptions to announce their first issue. Pornography becomes more intrusive and more threatening in its view of sexuality as it becomes respectable, and as the women in it become glamorous. Perhaps I am missing out on life not having such round breasts and such perfectly symmetrical labia, and not having a macho bloke around...Even if porn were not harmful to women in the street, what of the women who are paid to appear in pornographic films and magazines? It is generally agreed that child - ‘chicken’ - porn exploits and abuses the child models, that children cannot be said to be choosing freely to appear in pornography, and that the experience could seriously mess up a child’s sexuality. But the women in porn are freely consenting adults, aren’t they? Do they believe in pornography and the view of women’s sexuality portrayed in it - or do they just don for the money? Are they sisters, forced through lack of positive alternatives as women in our society to find employment and importance in porn or are they traitors, colluding in the degradation of all women for a few quick quid? And what does it do to them? Georgia Stark, an actress in blue movies, was quoted in Newsweek:The first film I made was really a downer. Afterwards I started to think about suicide. But after a while I got so I could do the Eleanor Rigby thing - you know, leave your mind in a jar by the door. Then I’d know I’m just an animal and they are taking pictures of an animal. I don’t like porn. How then do I differ from Mary Whitehouse? She like me finds porn degrading; in her terms it is anti-love and anti-sex, much of which I disconcertingly find myself in agreement with. She claims to enjoy sex, in its proper place. The reason I believe she and I are fighting on different sides is that she focuses her attacks on things that are not to my mind pornographic at all, but that are worthy, if not entirely successful, attempts to educate or explore. She is not solely concerned with images that distort, but also with those that try to describe sex as it actually happens. She vehemently attacks sex education in schools, but is quieter about hard porn in corner newsagents (although she is beginning to campaign against child porn). She became apoplectic over swear words on the Wednesday Play series on TV, some of which plays were remarkably sharp comments on our society. She finally managed to get Gay News prosecuted for ‘blasphemy’ because she could never prove it was ‘obscene’ there are many ‘obscene’ male homosexual magazines, but she concentrated on non-pornographic Gay News because it threatened to make homosexuals feel all right about being gay.She, and others like her, indicate to us the dangers of legislating against pornography. It is not only the most degrading pictures of women that would be banned, but also things that are trying to question or change society’s view of women and sex. Contraception information was illegal because it was considered obscene up until the 1930s in this country; and Spare Rib itself was banned in Eire this year as ‘usually or frequently indecent or obscene’ - for demonstrating to women how to examine our breasts for cancer. Censorship laws are always used against those who attempt to inform women about the basics of their reproductive organs, let alone their sexuality, while backstreet blue movies always find a way to survive.Mary Whitehouse’s reason for attacking pornography is precisely the opposite to mine. She wishes to maintain the sexual status quo, to preserve the stunted roles of women in our society. She is fighting to keep women divided into madonnas and whores, to keep sex disgusting and hidden, to keep women from self-knowledge. She claims to attack porn to protect women, but she does so in the name of the nuclear family and the sanctity of marriage - institutions that oppress women.I do not know if pornography and the Festival of Light are different sides of the same coin. Certainly both elements have co-existed as far back in society as one looks. It has often been argued - by liberal men - that wherever there is a restriction on acceptable sex, as in monogamous marriage, there will be a need for safe illicit outlets for men’s free-ranging sexuality. A case of men having their cake and eating it. Women, of course, have always had to choose one or the other, between the two male-defined views of their sexuality - between having no sexuality and putting up with sex as a wifely duty, and being defined totally by sex, as a ‘good time girl’. I myself feel caught up in this dichotomy still in my head; between feeling sex is unimportant and unnecessary, and seeing sex as a Life Force, underpinning my every action.But maybe Mary Whitehouse is losing, and pornography flourishes and grows. Maybe we should all now have the mentality of a golden-hearted whore, who loves like a man, within marriage, buying our husbands The Joy of Sex for Christmas. Or perhaps porn has got too big for its boots, and is actually undermining marriage; porn is now big business, so perhaps sex itself is becoming capitalistic, moving out on to the market place - with women’s bodies as commodities. What then will become of us?‘All the flacks make contracts. Contract sex. It means you agree to put out for so long for so much. You know? Like I have a two-year contract. Some girls got only a one-nighter or a monthly, that’s standard. You can be put out on your car at the end of the month with only a day’s notice. That’s no life. Course once in a while some real bulger, she ends up with a ten-year contract. I never met one, but I heard of them.’‘What happens when your contract runs out?’Gildina shrugged nervously. ‘Sometimes they renew. The first time I was on a yearly I got renewed by that flack - he was a lower-level ground transport smasher. If you’re dropped, sometimes you got a prospect. Sometimes you get by on one-nights or weekends till you turn up a prospect. But it drains you. Always worrying about maybe you’ll end up in a knockshop. Sometimes you can’t keep maintaining, and then your chances of getting even a lower-level flack run down.’(One possible future from Marge Piercy’s Woman On The Edge Of Time.)I don’t want to choose between Mary Whitehouse and the producers of High Society, between two equally unacceptable alternatives - between censoring all mention of sex through vaguely-worded laws that will be applied by men, and allowing pornography to invade my life at an ever-increasing rate, on Radio One and in packets of bubblegum, and even in the radical press. I believe we should not agitate for more laws against pornography, but should rather stand up together and say what we feel about it, and what we feel about our own sexuality, and force men to re-examine their own attitudes to sex and women implicit in their consumption of porn. We should talk to our local newsagents - many of whom feel pressured into stocking porn - or picket porn movies, or walk down Oxford Street with our shirts off. We must make it clear that porn is a symptom of our sexist society, a reflection of its assumptions; that it is violent and misogynistic, and nothing to do with the free expression of ‘healthy’ sex, but rather the truly ‘perverted’ desire to trample on another human being. We must choose the third alternative - women’s liberation.Love and thanks to Roisin McDonough and Vanessa Coode, and all who helped on their way past my kitchen table.SR.65, December 1977
Talking with an Egyptian Feminist: Nawal el SaadawiJILL NICHOLLS... Is clitoridectomy [physical removal of the clitoris] a common operation? Yes, especially in the rural areas where it’s 90 per cent. In the cities it’s about 50 per cent. But you know this female circumcision, it’s not related specifically to Islam, but to the patriarchal class system. Female circumcision is the remnant of the chastity belt, it’s trying to diminish female sexuality to fit it into monogamous marriage. Patriarchy based itself on monogamous marriage for women. If a woman has two husbands, fatherhood will never be known. So they diminished female sexuality physically by clitoridectomy or the chastity belt, or psychologically, because Freud in fact made what I call psychological clitoridectomy!...SR.78, January 1979
Action on ClitoridectomyJILL NICHOLLSClitoridectomy was the main issue discussed at a recent World Health Organization seminar on traditional health practices, held in Khartoum in Sudan. This was a real breakthrough as W H O has always been wary of taking up the subject.Representatives	 of seven countries including Egypt, Somalia, Nigeria and Kenya recommended that the operation (still widespread in Africa) be abolished in all its forms. These are ‘sunna’ circumcision, where the tip of the clitoris is removed; excision/clitoridectomy, where the entire clitoris and labia minora are removed, and sometimes part of the labia majora; and infibulation, where the two sides of the vulva are sewn up after excision.They want each country to form a national commission to find out how widely this is practised and to co-ordinate efforts against it, campaigning in the media and among midwives, traditional and modern doctors.Some of the doctors present wanted the operation to be ‘cleaned up’ and carried out in modern hospitals as an intermediate step, but all the women thought institutionalization was a real danger...SR.82, May 1979
How Can We Support Our Sisters?EDITORIALIf we are allowed to hear of clitoridectomy at all, it is as the custom of faraway tribal people. Our horror and anger are set at a distance; we are taught to see 24 million circumcised women as victims living in some unimaginable Dark Age, not sisters in exploitation. Yet the last known clitoridectomy in the West was performed as recently as 1953, in Kentucky, on a girl of twelve. The operation was popularized in the nineteenth century by a British doctor, Baker Brown, as a cure for ‘hysteria’ - autonomous sexual desire, leading to every other form of rebellion and ‘moral leprosy’ in a woman.... Today the same doctors might be performing brain surgery. Chemical and physical lobotomy are our cures for female ‘hysteria’. In Arab societies, the word is ‘fitna’- sexual disruption - and the cure is clitoridectomy. The West has its purely sexual mutilations too: almost half the hysterectomies in the US are now performed not from proven medical need but ‘in case’ something might later go wrong with a womb that is seen as disposable. (One quarter of all North American women over fifty have lost their wombs.) There are also the routine episiotomies to facilitate a quick convenient delivery for the doctor, often with horrible side effects which last for years; the ‘voluntary ‘ facelifts, and the breast implants that have caused women’s deaths.... These are our modern, progressive versions of clitoridectomy... new aspects of that long hatred of women’s bodies stretching back to our segregation in the tribal menstrual hut and the Christian churching services to rid us of the ‘filth’ of childbirth.In finding parallels, we are not saying that oppression is everywhere the same. We do not suffer the agonies of a Sudanese woman undergoing circumcision, but we are part of the same system. When we met Nawal el Saadawi last year, she spoke about what she called the psychological clitoridectomy of women in the West: ‘Sometimes you think you are free, but still you are not free’ - how many Western women do not even know that they have a clitoris? Some of the feminists she’d met abroad had seemed to miss connections - not only between Arab women’s oppression and their own, but between Arab women’s oppression and the conditions of their countries as a whole. Women like Saadawi cannot afford to separate their fight against clitoridectomy from the deliberate ‘underdevelopment’ and near-starvation of most communities where it’s practised. Nor should we...SR.92, March 1980
To School with FearPOLLY TALKED TO TOM COTTLEPolly, a small West Indian girl of thirteen, has lived with her family in the Brixton area of London for seven years. It’s a poor area compared with the rest of London: housing is worse, schools are overcrowded, and there are less jobs. The family had to move several times. Polly’s father works on budding sites said needs to live close by. But they are also constantly looking for a better place to live. Polly doesn’t mind moving too much but feels badly each time she has to leave an old set of schoolfriends. She does well in her schoolwork, and works extremely hard. But each new school gets more demanding than the one before. She always makes sure to choose a best friend in her new school, but she likes to be friendly with all her classmates - she hates fights and arguments. And the racial aspect of the fights only makes her feel that much more upset and confused. One Wednesday evening, she was assaulted and raped by three boys, none of whom she claims she knew, although she is certain they attend her school. Admitted as an emergency case to a hospital several miles from her neighbourhood, she talked to Tom Cottle, a friend of her family, who recorded what she said.I ask myself, what is it about it? And I’m not the only one, you know. Many people feel like me. But I can’t keep going, not when you hear all the things they’re saying to you every day. Then, you know, two people will have a fight and it will never end, and everybody round it is part of it. If you want one person to win and you tell this to the wrong person then you lose some more friends. It keeps going like this too. It’s not only black against white, but mostly that’s what it is. That seems to be all that’s happening in school these days. You can’t tell the teachers about it. Of course they know, but if you tell them the other kids think you’re weak, or scared, or not loyal to them. No one is allowed to tell anybody they’re afraid. I tell my best friend Jessie, but I wouldn’t tell anybody else. Some days I get so scared before I have to go to school I feel like I’m going to, you know, throw up. I run into the bathroom but nothing happens. I know it won’t because it’s nerves.       Rachel DoughertyEvery day I walk by this long brick wall. You have to go through this little passageway to get to school. There’s usually a cat there climbing around. When I see him I tell him, bring me good luck. He usually runs away, which I tell myself is a good sign. Then I tell myself, no matter what anybody tells you, don’t be upset, don’t be afraid. Sometimes it works, but most of the time it doesn’t, especially if Jessie isn’t with me. It’s better when she’s with me. I rather have someone yell out, there goes two nigger girls, than have me be there all by myself. You don’t know what they’re going to do next when they do it, and it’s always happening. You don’t know what’s the best thing to do either. Like they’ll say, Hey, you short nigger, what are you, some kind of a pygmy? That’s my own special name because I’m short. Aren’t they clever! I never know what to do. Some people say you shout back at them so they won’t do it again. But I couldn’t get myself to do that. What am I supposed to do when it happens, like, when we’re on the playground or the stairs? Or in the class too? It happens in class too. Hey, pygmy, you read the lesson for today? What am I supposed to do? Jessie says I should keep my mouth shut and tell one of the boys, like, the biggest person I see, that kid over there called me a pygmy. That’s what she says to do because she says if we don’t start fighting back they’ll never stop doing it to us. Maybe she’s right, but I can’t see myself going up to some guy and telling him what someone said to me.The boys tell us too, to tell them. They say they’ll go after anyone we want them to, that they’re not afraid of a single person in the school. I can’t believe what’s going on. If you tell someone you don’t know what kind of trouble you may be starting, and if you keep your mouth shut, you know what you’re letting go on. But everyone keeps saying, they aren’t going to hurt you, they aren’t going to hurt you, nothing will happen. But I don’t see why they should be allowed to call me things that has to do with my being coloured, and that’s mostly what they yell. Everybody fights about it. Even Jessie’s been in some fights. I didn’t see her, but I did see another a few months ago. I got so frightened that time I did throw up. One of the worst things was what I was thinking about, how, like, at first I was afraid she would get hurt and I started to cry, and then, without even thinking about it, I found myself hoping she would kill this white girl. I was crying but I wanted her to kill the white girl. I think mostly because the girl was white and because of what she said. She called Jessie some horrible name, I didn’t even understand it at first. Jessie didn’t either, but you could tell it wasn’t a compliment.Then, you know, when they fight, everybody crowds round and then they start fighting, like they did this one time when Jessie fought this girl Shea. They were all fighting, and I ran away because I got scared. That time I told my mother, which I usually don’t do. My mother told me she was going to school to see what was happening. She went too, but the master told her there was nothing the school could do if children fought before or after school; it wasn’t their responsibility. He didn’t think the fighting was all that bad. Kids have always fought, that’s what he told my mother. He said he was surprised she would find all this new. Didn’t she have fights in her neighbourhood where she went to school? That’s what he told her. I mean, that’s what I know he told her, because some of the other things she wouldn’t tell me, but she told my father. I know one of them was that I was supposed to be known as a little bit of a baby, that’s what the master said; that just because I was a girl didn’t mean I shouldn’t have to fight and protect myself. He said he thought coloured people were teaching this to their children. She said she thought he was prejudiced, and he told her our kind is too sensitive about all this stuff. Besides he said, he did a special favour for us letting me into the school when we moved here because he could have said no because the classes were so big. My mother told him no one in this country does any favours for us and he told her she was wrong; that’s all coloured people do is ask for favours. Anyway, he said there’s nothing that could be done about the fighting. It was happening in the school, sure, maybe once a week too, which is a lie because it happens all the time, but the problem isn’t the school, it’s the country. So my mother said, you mean it’s all our fault and he said, you said it, Mrs Davies, I didn’t.I was surprised too, because I thought the master was a real nice man. At least I never saw him do anything bad to anybody. I don’t know all that much what the other kids think of him. Jessie hates him because he blamed her that one time for starting the fighting which she didn’t. I know, because I was there. But I always thought he liked us. Like, Mrs Brainaird likes us. She’s always asking me how I’m doing and if I have problems. I don’t talk to her, but maybe I could. You can’t tell with some of these people, like, how they’re going to be if they have to take a side. I think a lot of the teachers would like to take our side once in a while, but they’re afraid what the master or the assistants might say to them. Lots of them aren’t much better off than we are, I guess, although they don’t talk about it with us. Well that’s not completely true, because Mrs Strandy, she told Jessie and this other girl how she was afraid to teach in the school with all the fighting, so she was looking for a new job. They had a long talk about it. Jessie told her maybe she could do something to make it better, but she said, no, she was leaving, even if it meant she wouldn’t be able to find another job. She’d rather go on the dole than reach here. That’s what she said. Then she told them, it was better before they let all the coloureds in. Can you believe her saying this to Jessie, who’s coloured! She didn’t even realize what she was saying. She told them, it was better before they let the coloureds in. So Jessie said, well, Mrs Strandy, if you haven’t noticed yet, we’re coloured. So Mrs Strandy said, of course I know you’re coloured, but it’s not the children I’m talking about it’s their parents! It’s all your fathers who don’t work and don’t want to, and all your mothers having all these children. That’s what the matter is. It’s never the children’s fault. So Jessie just looks at her and says Oh! That’s all, just oh!Doesn’t my school sound like a wonderful place? Now do you know why I don’t like going around there, no matter how much I might team, which I don’t think is all that much. Most of the time all I learn is that a lot of people in my school think I’m a coloured pygmy, but I ought to be learning a little more than that. And another thing, if these people, like the master and Mrs Strandy, have all these feelings about us, I would like to know how they can be allowed to stay in the school, and some of those people have the most important jobs over there, you know. They make the decisions and they have all these ideas. That’s all we hear from them: it’s the coloureds. Pretty soon, it will get bad for me and I really will be able to throw up before I walk to school, instead of just thinking that I do. Like, right now, telling all of this to you gives me the same feelings I have before I walk there in the morning. It’s like I need my lucky black and white cat to tell you what I think about school, and we aren’t anywhere near school now, are we? I’m not sure where we are here, but it feels that we’re a long, long way from school. At least I hope it’s a long way from school. I know this isn’t really a holiday but I’m trying to pretend it is.SR.62, September 1977
‘They’re Killing Us in Here’PERMINDER DHILLONThe morning after the first national demonstration organized by Afro-Caribbean and Asian women, I went into work and a white man asked me, ‘But what is it you are fighting against? I thought you were feminists. What’s this about police brutality?’That is the sort of question Black feminists get asked. Why did Black women organize a demonstration against police brutality and immigration harassment? What happened in Southall on 23 April might give the answers.That was the day that the National Front held their electoral meeting in Southall town hall. They had been given permission to bring their racial hatred right into the Black community. The people of Southall decided they would sit down peacefully outside the town hall, stopping the Front from holding their meeting by their sheer numbers, and they obtained police permission to do this. Nearly everyone in Southall from the Afro-Caribbean and Asian communities came out to take part. But as early on as 2 p.m. people were being arrested for trivialities like crossing the street, or refusing to move instantly when told to do so. A hundred such arrests were part of deliberate provocation by police, and set the tempo for what was to follow.After 3 p.m. Southall had become a town under siege. People were not allowed in or out of buildings. Police with dogs roamed the streets. Around 5 p.m. a group of us Asian women were finally allowed out of the building in which we’d been stranded all afternoon. We joined the crowd behind a cordon of police, who were protecting the side entrance to the town hall. All streets leading to the building had been cleared of demonstrators. No one was allowed to leave, to go home. ‘It’s for your own protection,’ they told us.Women of Southall know what police protection means - being beaten with their truncheons, while a few streets away a Black sister is sexually assaulted by white youths.At 6.30 the police began to show their force: mounted police, police with dogs, and the special patrol group with riot shields and truncheons laid into them, forcing them to run into the near-by park. Hitting out, pulling off the turbans of Sikhs, dragging them along the ground by their hair - while women suffered racial and sexist abuse. They were grabbed by their breasts and told, ‘Move, you black whores!’ Some older women who could not climb over the rails into the park were dragged away and arrested. The group I was in, young and old women, linked arms, and in this way managed through our combined strength to drag ourselves free from the police.Then the S P G, three with shields and three with truncheons in a special pyramid formation, chased people into ‘People Unite’, a cultural centre, which has long been the target of police harassment. A Black sister described what happened: ‘Everyone rushed upstairs, and the police followed breaking down the door. We ended up in the top room. They shouted to us to come down, women first, and that there’d be no trouble. But when we came down they started kicking us. I was hit on the head and my friend, in the face and head. She lost two teeth.’An Afro-Caribbean sister ran towards us in the park crying and shouting, ‘They are killing us in there!’ What could we tell her? That this was nothing for any Black woman? How many Black people have been killed by the British state - through police brutality, through gross neglect in hospitals, or out of grief over families divided by immigration laws?...Around to, many of us gathered to watch the news at a restaurant, where Rock Against Racism and Indian music had been blaring our all evening, drowning out the National Front speakers inside the town hall. Their wounds still bleeding, people saw the Commissioner of Police, the Home Secretary, and other ‘experts’ on the Black community defending the right of the N F to hold their meeting, and condemning the people of Southall for their unprovoked attack on the police! As usual, only pictures of injured policemen were shown - nothing of the pregnant women being kicked and the countless other police assaults. The next day I saw a film crew, apparently from the BBC, selectively filming broken windows of white-owned shops. When I asked why, I was told, ‘Fuck off! We know all about thugs like you!’But the next day the tone of the Prime Minister and so on quickly changed when it became clear that Blair Peach - a white male - had died. Then with the hypocrisy typical of the Labour Party, they called for a ban on N F meetings. But even this did not deter Ealing council from passing a motion commending the police for their ‘courage and patience’. Beatrice Howard, leader of the council commented, ‘It was surprising that women were on the streets that day. It was inviting trouble.’SR.84, July 1979
Nuclear Weapons: Stay Home and DieLUCY WHITMANThe threat of nuclear disaster looms over us, the ultimate symbol of our powerlessness in an ask-no-questions-and-you’ll-be-told-no-lies society.The government wants us to retreat into our nuclear families, get under the table, shut our eyes and hold our noses while the world outside falls to pieces. We’re supposed to keep the radio tuned for government instructions, which will no doubt be interspersed with smash hit singles such as the Electric Light Orchestra’s ‘I’m alive!’ or ‘There’s gonna be a party all over the world’.What has nuclear war got to do with women? It certainly wasn’t our idea. Yet however peacefully most of us - Margaret Thatcher excepted - want to live our lives, we will all be targets if there is a nuclear war. Even so, isn’t it really a ‘human’ issue, not intrinsically connected to feminism?I think there is a connection. Like a lot of other feminists, I am convinced that nuclear weapons and nuclear power are in fact the most brutal manifestation yet of the murderous patriarchal system which has brought about so much misery throughout recorded history.... A male-dominated society divides people up very rigidly according to whether they are women or men, divides up work and feelings and types of behaviour into those more ‘appropriately’ masculine or feminine, and persistently undervalues the work, feelings and behaviour associated with women, the ‘weaker’ sex. Men are supposed to be tough, active, inventive and cool-headed, and women are supposed to be loving, yielding, supportive and emotional. Housework and childcare are not even recognized as work, and although romantic love and motherhood are sentimentally idealized, compassion, consideration for others and other ‘feminine’ attributes are held in scorn in the ‘real’ world of industry and international relations. Ruthless business deals are applauded however much suffering they may cause, and war is glorified as it gives men an opportunity to demonstrate just how manly - i.e. competitive, cruel and uncompromising - they are.Men in our society are encouraged to look on war as a thrilling adventure, as any glance at the sickening quantity of war films and war comics and toys produced each year will show.I don’t believe that ‘human nature’ accounts for men’s aggression any more than it accounts for women’s pacifism and/or passivity. If it did, there would be no need to make such strenuous efforts to crush any spontaneous demonstrations of tenderness and gentleness in boys, taunting those who will not conform to the hard-hitting ‘norm’ by calling them cissies and softies...... Of course there are many individual men who are passionately dedicated to the cause of disarmament, and I do not mean to sneer at them or suggest that they should be excluded from the struggle. But I do believe that patriarchy as an institution, the deliberate subjection of women to men, is ultimately responsible for producing a culture which can countenance the nuclear arms race.SR.99, November 1980
‘The Primary Purpose is to Help Raped Women Regain Their Strength as Individuals ‘: Crisis Centre OpensVICTORIA GREENA Rape Crisis Centre has opened in the London area to help women who have been raped. The counsellors provide sympathetic, non-judgemental support; they offer advice and information on police and legal procedures to those women who choose to report the rape; and they will accompany victims to the police station if their help is needed.The majority of rapes in this country are never reported, probably because the victim quite realistically dreads the experience of police interrogation and the ensuing trial. The Centre does not see itself as a means of increasing the number of convictions for rape but believe it can best help the victim by providing the sort of support which will enable her to choose about prosecuting or not.Many rape victims find their whole lives are disrupted by the experience and need to express their fears and reactions to someone who understands their situation. Women often suffer for years after a rape; Crisis Centres in the USA have had appeals for help from women raped ten years previously. Often the main problem is the victim’s attitude to herself, and talking it over with people who might have had the same experience is an important step towards re-establishing her sense of self.The Centre in London is run on a collective basis; the idea for a twenty-four-hour emergency service came up in November 1974. Initially the service was limited but it now provides support on a variety of levels at any time of the day.Registered as a charity, the group has applied for Urban Aid and other government grants. So far it has received grants from two trust funds and is able to rent office space and pay two full-time members of staff. The counsellors are voluntary and the ultimate aim is to have enough people to provide for two women on duty at the centre all the time.Counsellors go through a training system involving an introductory meeting with the collective, who describe the Centre’s outlook on rape and the function of the Centre. They are given a reading list on the subject, they observe a rape case at the Old Bailey and go to a V D clinic to familiarize themselves with the procedures.The Centre emphasizes that it is there to provide support for victims and not to direct them. Counsellors will go to a victim wherever she is if that is what she wants. She can go to the Centre when she needs help and can rely on sensitive, supportive comfort from the women there. The primary purpose of the collective is to help raped women regain their strength as individuals.Any woman needing assistance at the police station will be accompanied there and will be made aware of her rights during the proceedings. For example, counsellors can ensure she knows she is entitled to be examined by her own doctor rather than the police surgeon. Counsellors will go with victims to V D clinics and help offset the trauma of that experience so soon after the rape. They provide women with information on the law and will help them through the trial itself.Education is also an important function. Police stations, hospital casualty departments, community health centres and V D clinics have been sent circulars describing the Centre. The collective intends to publish information sheets and give talks explaining its service in an effort to educate those groups who come into contact with rape victims. It also plans to produce and disseminate leaflets and posters advertising its work.Ideally, there should be a network of small groups all over the country providing the service offered by the London centre. Some groups are beginning already: Newcastle-on- Tyne should have its own Rape Crisis Centre soon and there have been inquiries from other areas. The London Centre has been putting women in touch with each other and will help them to start operating on their own.Reactions to the Centre have been varied. The police are wary though fairly sympathetic. They are worried that the service might discourage women from reporting rape. The police feel it is easier to get victims over the hurdles in the system when they are ignorant of what is involved. The police are mainly concerned to catch rapists and feel women will not come forward if they understand the difficulties facing them within the legal processes.The collective has found that women police officers are often more sympathetic towards rape victims and are themselves sceptical of the official line that the police do not harass rape victims. The Home Office recently issued a five-point directive on police procedure relating to the treatment of rape victims. Intended to ensure that women reporting rape are treated with more gentleness and respect, it is not statutory and its implementation is left to the police discretion.The forthcoming Private Member’s Bill to reform the rape laws does not, the Rape Crisis Centre says, do much to improve the position of the rape victim in court. The definition of rape remains unchanged. Vaginal rape - the penetration of the vagina by a penis - is the only form of rape under the law. A large number of rapes are committed with bottles, sticks or some other object; anal rape and fellatio are common assaults and no less damaging and humiliating than vaginal rape, but are treated as indecent assault and seen as less important.The collective believes the Bill’s well-publicized proposals for changing the laws of evidence are meaningless. The introduction of evidence on a victim’s previous sexual history should be ruled out altogether, but the putative law leaves that decision to the discretion of the judge. If the judge decides such evidence is relevant the jury must leave the court and so the victim is automatically cast as provocative. As the Centre points out, the legal profession is more or less indifferent to the situation of the rape victim. This was made clear by the Haldane Society - a collection of liberal lawyers - who voted to support last year’s Law Lords (Morgan) ruling. Only three members opposed the ruling, and they were the only women in the group.Clearly, it would be good if all rape victims brought charges against their attackers but in the present legal climate it is a big price for women to pay. A victim must face interrogation about her character and sexual history, without the right to call character witnesses in her own defence. She is seen as a witness at the trial and therefore in no need of legal representation or witnesses of her own.The rapist, meanwhile, may call character witnesses and the law does not allow any evidence of his previous sexual history to be used against him. In his evidence he may, and most often does, attempt to impugn the reputation of his victim and thus establish a case for ‘honest’ belief in keeping with the Morgan ruling.Rape victims can only hope for justice when the case is judged on its own merit without recourse to the traditional smear tactics allowed under the law; nor will women see the point in bringing charges until the testimony of the victim is accorded equal value to that of the rapist. ‘Honest belief’ on the part of the rapist is impossible to prove or disprove. The sexism of the Morgan ruling shows the rape victim that her attacker will not be convicted unless she gets herself beaten up and manages to see a doctor immediately after the rape.The Rape Crisis Centre does not believe it should try and persuade women to press charges under these circumstances. Quite often the due process of law manages to more damage to the rape victim than did the assault itself.The Centre will not allow its address to be published. Nor will it fulfil the prurient expectations of the press by giving out information about the cases it deals with. Since it started operating on 15 March, journalists from the national press have tried to break in and take photographs, and there have been requests from journalists wanting to sit in on the work of the Centre. Others have wanted a series of case histories. The women running the Centre are desperate to keep the address secret and already they have had to appeal to the Attorney General to prevent its publication in a national daily.The day the telephone number was published the lines were kept busy by men ringing with obscene threats; one rang every ten minutes for thirty-six hours. Recently in Australia, the Sydney Rape Crisis Centre was attacked with a bomb.To be effective the Centre must provide a quiet, supportive environment for the women who go there. They must feel secure in the knowledge that their experiences are treated with respect. For this reason the collective feels its policy towards the media is absolutely justifiable.SR.46, May 1976
Defending OurselvesALISON FELLAfter the meeting Janey dropped me at Euston. ‘Sure you’ll get home OK from here?’ ‘Oh, I’ll be fine, I’ll jump into a taxi.’ So I stood on the kerb staring up the roaring vista of the Euston Road while the green Volvo swung right down Gower Street. I waved cheerily. Bravely.Euston was a hell of a place to drop me. I was an idiot, I should have made more demands, showed more of my fear and reluctance. But I felt I’d already exposed more than enough feelings in the meeting. I’d imagined Euston Road would be bright and brimming with lights, loud with the rumble of trains disgorging solid travellers into creeping ranks of taxis. But the station was so dull, so black; only a few lights as dim as gas lamps burned along the top. The drunks were lurching in the park where the grass - always foul and flea-filled - had dried to bone-yellow in the drought. I stood well out on the kerb to avoid the shadow of the scrubby hedge which borders it, and peered back into the oncoming three-lane traffic surge for a taxi’s light. Not many taxis, and all of those full. I paced along to the traffic lights. No police cars, either.I wore flat childish sandals, black blouse - on the prim side - and a knee-length cotton skirt. My hair lay flat, a bit sweaty from the endless heat and the stresses of the meeting. I glanced down Gower Street - perhaps Janey and the others had thought better of it, perhaps they were parked there, craning to see me jump, safe and serene, into a cab? No. I was alone with my pluck. It was nearly 1 a.m.There were no women in sight - except the delectable Morgan’s Rum girls displayed on the hoarding opposite - and there were no couples. Euston Road was the domain of men only.Was I safer standing still? Was it then perfectly obvious that I was intent on hailing cabs? Or did I look more purposeful walking, not waiting? I walked a bit. A man was coming in the opposite direction - a teacher, I thought - bearded and a bit portly. He carried books, well, that was OK, it was useful to have types like that around if things got heavy; he came level; he was almost past; he made smacking, kissing noises with his fat lips.I started towards the kerb again and stared back into the traffic flow. Immediately a light-coloured saloon veered in from the middle lane and slowed, one man at the wheel. Youngish, I registered, flashy Playboy clothes. I turned away from the kerb and sped off towards King’s Cross again. He drove on a little way and drew in. I stared straight ahead at the Shaw library and willed my trembling legs to walk straight and sure, willed my hips to rivet like a well-corseted grandmother’s, willed them not to sway an inch. I sensed him lean across and wind the window down: ‘Wanna lift babe?’ he slurred. I walked faster, hatred raging in my veins - shaking, not looking at him, I flapped my hand in a sort of ‘Get Thee behind me, Satan’ gesture and yelled ‘SOD OFF, SOD OFF!’Another man was approaching from King’s Cross direction. He wore a suit, he looked working class, oldish. This time I wasn’t going to risk hearing the obscene invitations when I passed, so as I came level with him I went back out to the kerb, looking back slightly (the other bastard was still kerb-crawling me, ahead) and waved desperately at nothing on the dark road. A mistake. The guy in the suit took this as an invitation and turned after me, and followed me, he was lighting a fag and preparing to make an approach. I started to walk again, faster and faster. I was beginning to pant with terror and disgust. But still he caught up with me, and muttered something in that vile prowler’s hiss - they move their lips - in contempt, or self-contempt, who knows? Little eyes flashing in the dark. I don’t remember what I shrieked at this one. Meanwhile, another guy had stopped in his tracks, circled back and was crossing the road towards me.This time I knew I couldn’t stand it any longer, they were closing in and Euston Road was like a chasm with me at the bottom, wounded panicking prey; cars were slowing for the lights so I raced out into the road and yelled at a cab, ‘Get me off this bloody toad, for Christ’s sake!’ The cab wasn’t actually for hire but he said, ‘Only to Highbury? Oh, OK then.’I fell inside and collapsed on the scat like a rag doll. ‘Did you have a hard time then, love?’ the driver inquired sympathetically. ‘Terrible,’ I blurted. ‘They just won’t leave you alone, one after the other, it’s just bloody dreadful, I couldn’t bear it.’ I looked down at my hand, which lay white on the black plastic seat. It was feeble, quivering. The skirt felt stupidly floppy and insubstantial - I needed boots, mail on my fists, and a weapon in my bag, not leaflets. Soft belly, soft breasts, jelly legs.‘Smoke, love?’‘Got one, thanks.’ I memorized the taxi number. 5495. Then I said to myself, ‘Who’s in a bad state of paranoia, then? Just because he’s being sympathetic.’No lights on in the house - it looked deserted. I jumped out of the cab and searched for cash.‘You wouldn’t be thinking of puttin’ the coffee pot on for me, now love?’ I think I went into shock then, because all I could manage was a ‘No’ that was positively demure. I gave him a tip. And a stiff little smile with it.(And people are surprised that we’re ambivalent about our sexuality and our womanhood?)VICTORIA GREEN AND ROZSIKA PARKERAny woman walking alone late at night shares Alison’s experience. Her fear - our fear - of violence is rational. A woman had been raped on the Euston Road only weeks before Alison’s journey home. Yet the effect that threatened violence has on our lives far outweighs the actual incidents of public assault. For example, we would avoid the Euston Road (at night) even though we’re aware that most violence happens at home between people who know one another.Walking through cat-calls we expect violence. It marked us from the moment our mothers said, ‘Don’t talk to strange men.’ We began to see ourselves as weak, vulnerable beings in a world which values strength and courage. ‘I looked down at my hand which lay white on the black plastic seat,’ writes Alison. ‘It was feeble, quivering.’The threat of male violence is one reason, paradoxically, why women remain dependent on men. In terror Alison looked for a protector: ‘A teacher... he carried books, that was OK. It was useful to have types like that around if things got heavy.’ And remember Judge Morris at the Brixton mugging trial in October, who suggested the need for ‘some form or other of vigilante corps comprised of citizens concerned for the safety of lone women’.If men are seen either as rapists or bodyguards, a woman on her own is obviously ‘asking for it’ - she’s fair game. Our usual defence is to deny our sexuality: ‘I willed my hips to rivet like a well-corseted grandmother’s.’ It doesn’t work; we stay scared and they keep whistling. But what if we learn to defend ourselves physically. If we appeared self-confident and self-possessed, would men then be different?The roots of violence and the reasons for the harassment of women in the streets are too complex for such an immediate strategy to be a real solution. Perhaps, instead of individual women learning to defend themselves, we should be organizing against the violent society. But we’ve got to deal with the fears we have today. At least by taking responsibility for our own safety at a day-to-day level, we might feel less hedged in by fear, more self-confident, and able to change things.Spare Rib talked to women who have deliberately stepped outside the ‘weaker sex’ role - strengthening their muscles, learning to kick, punch and block, and run very fast. We asked women karate students whether learning self-defence had lessened their fears. Did they see themselves differently and had men’s attitudes towards them changed?Most karate classes last toughly two hours and are divided into two sections. The first half is taken up with rigorous exercises to strengthen and loosen muscles: push-ups, back and neck exercises. They include katas - a series of rhythmic, controlled movements necessary to fighting - the fighting stance, kicking, punching and blocking.The second half consists of fighting. People are paired off according to their level of competence and the fighting is tightly disciplined - punches and kicks are pulled back so that you don’t hurt your opponent. Achievement is marked by examinations and you earn coloured belts as you become more proficient - the final stage being the black belt.The atmosphere of classes is intense and serious, the only noises are the thumps of bare feet on the floor and the voice of the teacher directing the class. The most traditional classes are very hierarchical with much bowing to the instructor who maintains rigid discipline. Others are less formal, but still retain some bowing and the teacher keeps close control.A karate green belt (2nd grade on) who has been going to classes in King’s Cross, London, told us that when she started two years ago she was ‘often the only woman in the class. Today more and more young working women are joining though we are still a minority.’ What do karate instructors think about the influx of women - do they believe women can use unarmed combat effectively? Do they treat women in their classes in the same way as men?John Anderson of the Budokwai club in London thinks women suffer from their conditioning: ‘They are not used to hard exercise and they are not as aggressive as men.’ But he thinks women have better bodies for karate because they are more supple; once they have learned to discipline themselves they can become very good. His women students do all the same work as men, taking the same examinations, but they don’t do the hard fighting demanded of the men in the higher grades. Mr Chang of the Wu Shu Kwan kung-fu club in London says that he treats women in his class with greater care because they are not as tough as men, they are more motivated to learn self-defence but are less aggressive. He too remarked that we are conditioned against sustained physical effort. His solution is to ‘give a little more freedom to women - let them get used to the atmosphere. They have freer expression of themselves at first. At the moment men have a higher achievement than women but the gap is narrowing.’ In Mr Chang’s class beginners only fight with experienced students who teach them how to punch, kick and block.An instructor at an all-woman class, Pauline Fuller, who teaches karate at the Women’s Free Arts Alliance, disagrees with both men. She thinks that women should be pushed just as hard as men and that they should be forced to bring out their aggression. ‘I used to think women were naturally less aggressive than men, but now I don’t think so. In my class I make them work, I don’t let them rest when they are tired; they have to learn that they can’t just give up because they are women. Mixed classes are no good for women because then they take on the feminine role and don’t push themselves. The men indulge them and they just don’t take it seriously. In my class the women understand they have to keep going no matter how bruised or tired they are - surprisingly none of them have dropped out yet.’One woman we talked to felt that karate classes, by encouraging competition and shows of strength, promote machismo amongst men, making them patronizing towards women learning to fight. In her experience women were either ridiculed as butch or discouraged by not being taken seriously. But other women disagreed, insisting that the men were not hostile, just bewildered at the prospect of fighting women. And a more women join classes and gain competence, attitudes towards them are changing.       Why did you learn self-defence?Most of the women we questioned said they had taken up karate partly for self-protection and partly to keep fit. Sue is thirty-five, small and slight. She felt that she had gone to pieces physically after having two children but it wasn’t until she visited China that she started karate classes: ‘It seemed obvious that Chinese women were keen on being strong, to be able to use their strength if they needed it. So I thought of strength, not just in terms of being able to fight but in order to work to lift heavy boxes, pick up heavy objects. I had always been seen as someone who was frail. I remember my father saying to my husband that I was frail and needed looking after, although I was very seldom sick.’The practical and symbolic importance of being strong for Sue is clear. But Mary is a tall, strong woman of thirty - why did she take up karate? She explained that she lives alone in a flat where she used to be too petrified to undress and go to bed at night, and having a bath was unthinkable. On long winter nights she’d sit rigid, listening for The Rapist to start breaking down the front door. ‘I was never afraid in the streets, only when I came home and sat in the flat. I knew that karate was something I needed for self-protection.’Other women never felt vulnerable at home, only in the streets. ‘I disliked my own nervousness in the street,’ Anna told us. ‘I went to Paris with my sister; we were hassled. I said to one of the men, “I’ll hit you”, he said he’d love it. I slapped him and he kicked me in the belly. Then it became a complete brawl. Luckily his friend didn’t join in but I fought badly, ineffectually. Eventually he ran away, dropping his packet of Gauloises. We had a moral victory at least.’ Anna is thirty-six, with two children; she began to consider karate but it was six months before she joined a class.Her daughter started karate when she was eleven, ‘because Anna did it and I was already being whistled at in the street. It was a glamour thing, too. I didn’t like my school and I thought they would hate me less if I could say I learned karate.’ There are a number of girls between seven and fifteen in Mr Chang’s classes. They want to learn to defend themselves against bullies.Barbara, aged twenty-five, plays in a rock band. She told us that she needed karate for the life she leads, and she has to be strong to carry the group’s equipment: ‘I was really surprised when I saw how much I could carry and feel annoyed that I wasn’t taught to use my muscles. It’s an attitude, I just carry things now.’       Has karate lessened your fears?All felt it had, but Mary, previously the most beset with fears, was loudest in its praise. Once too frightened to undress at night, she now sits comfortably at home listening to music instead of waiting, ears peeled, for the sounds of the front door shattering. She thinks it’s because karate has taught her control over her body. Maggie Lomax (SR.16) described the key to karate: ‘It puts greatest emphasis on a supple body and an alert mind. The moment you stiffen up your impetus stops, and the essence of Shotokai (karate) is that you’re always ready, moving in your mind even before your body sets off.’But why should learning to control her movements and sharpen her responses have cased Mary’s fear? She explained that she now comes forward to face confrontations instead of panicking and freezing like a frightened rabbit. ‘It stopped me being so numb. I feel more able to withstand a situation where I feel I might get hurt.’Feeling sceptical we reminded her of her fear that somebody might at any moment break down the door of her flat. ‘What would I do? I’d be able in move into action immediately. Although one obviously has inhibitions about phoning the police - that’s what I’d do.’Her new confidence has changed her relationships: ‘I confront people much more. I have much more straightforward relationships, less messy.’ And it’s affected her attitude towards her body. Like many large women she felt pressured into hiding her size, stooping and suffering, resenting her height, scrupulously avoiding skirts and things she thought looked incongruous on her. ‘Karate reaches you to accept what you are and to make the most of it. The extraordinary thing is that now. ‘I accept and use my height, I no longer feel tall.’Remembering Alison’s comment, ‘And people are surprised that we’re ambivalent about our sexuality and our womanhood,’ we asked Mary if she felt different about her sexuality. ‘I really do - you know that feeling women have that they are dirty? I don’t have that any more. Quite often when I wear a skirt I don’t wear knickers. I don’t like the idea of my skirt blowing up and the world seeing - but there is something about it that is sort of exhilarating. And I feel much more confident about making love. I can ask for what I want and express pleasure - that takes a lot of doing. You feel so vulnerable. But once you have started to value your body, you imagine that other people will a well.’A lot of women were strong, confident children who, only in adolescence, learned that women were supposed to be weak. Valuing physical fitness begins to reverse that conditioning. But getting fit is hard work and karate requires real commitment.Does self-confidence stop verbal assault and harassment in the street?‘It’s good to be hostile and confident, to express opposition instead of fear. An initial response of confidence is vital. You walk differently when you are confident. You are more relaxed and at home with your body,’ said Anna. And Barbara added, ‘I feel renewed after karate classes so I don’t notice the hassles so much when I’m bicycling home.’But our general impression is that though women feel more secure, men remain much the same. ‘Last night I was walking down the street in one of those huge plastic bicycle rain capes,’ said Sue, ‘and still a man stuck out his hand as I was going by.’Do you feel you	can physically defend yourself if you’re attacked?Pauline Fuller, aged thirty-one, and a black belt, was attacked at night in Nottingham. One of a group of five men pushed her into a doorway where she was trapped. But, she says, ‘I dropped him and his friends were so surprised they did nothing to help him. As I ran away I heard one of them say, “Did she hit you?”’ Pauline has been doing karate for fifteen years while the other women have been going to classes for about two years. We got the impression that karate had not yet equipped them with an infallible weapon but rather with attitude which protected them from fear. They no longer feel completely powerless so street hassles are neither as frightening nor as infuriating. They’ve had some experience of fighting - it’s no longer a foreign country.We asked Anna what she’d do if she was attacked: ‘Well, it would depend on the circumstances, whether they were really aiming for you or just anyone. I have threatened people. I was walking with a friend in Shaftesbury Avenue just talking when two blokes blocked our path and tried to pick us up. I took up a fighting stance and said, “You’re in our way.” They moved. But sexual innuendo is sometimes just a ritual and it makes me very uncomfortable about reacting aggressively.’Sue is not at all confident that she could defend herself in all situations. ‘But I do know that I wouldn’t hesitate to kick hard. I used to lose my temper when I fought, charge in, head down, flailing in a classically female way. I never thought of kicking, except with vicious little kicks from behind. Now I would raise my knee and kick hard, straight on - much more effective.’A real problem is assessing the situation facing you - fast - and deciding whether or not it is a case for self-defence or a sprint out of danger. Margaret abandoned karate when she realized that she couldn’t distinguish between real and threatened violence. ‘I was in Paris. A guy came up and grabbed my breast. Instantly I slammed him across the face. He would have flattened me with one blow. To fight back inadequately when faced with real violence can be just dangerous. There should be far more discussion amongst women learning karate about the difference between real danger and muscle flexing, swaggering.’Mary thinks she’d always ‘get away as quickly as possible’ knowing that she was fit and well shod enough to run very fast. Her response is in line with the central philosophy of karate that you ‘gradually rid yourself of your ego, that part of you that makes you want to stand and fight to prove you’re stronger than your opponent’.Barbara, however, did use what she learned in class. Her band was playing in a pub when a man began trying to distract them and make trouble: ‘You’ve got power when you are on stage, all that amplification makes you much stronger than them. The men who hassle us do it because they are angry at seeing women with that sort of power, and this one was angry. He punched a woman in the mouth and then started boasting about it, so I punched him to the ground.’Are you worried about aggression in yourselves?We noticed that once women learn to use their bodies as weapons, they respond in ways that could be called male. For example, they assume the dominant role of protector. On late-night tube trains Mary finds herself slipping off her rings when she senses trouble, in anticipation of fighting off attackers for her friends. We see this not as role-reversal but as essential defence. But men - and other women too - would characterize Barbara and Pauline as ‘aggressive women’. It’s as if a woman can only gain approval by remaining helpless - start looking after yourself and you’re an aggressive woman. Inevitably, fear of being labelled aggressive makes women hesitant to take up karate.What does it mean to you to be fit and strong?When Mary began to get fit she gave up smoking and started to eat sensitively. Looking back on how she used to treat her body she feels it was almost masochistic: ‘Today I feel I am indulging myself in a way I really need to be indulged when I do karate exercises.’As we talked to the women, we began to see that getting strong has radically changed how they feel about themselves, greatly increasing their self-assurance. However, when we visited classes and women said to us, ‘OK, try and move my arm,’ holding out a rock-hard limb, our envy was mixed with disquiet. Were women going to become as anxious and obsessive about developing their muscles to protect themselves as they had been about keeping their figures to obtain a protector? Would they adopt typical male vanity about rippling muscles and superior strength?But we realized that learning karate doesn’t build a Charlotte Atlas physique, it strengthens the muscles you have. Most of the women we saw were lithe, and some said with pleasure that karate had fined them down. And anyway, women don’t get strong in order to be one up on other people, but for practical purposes and to deal with their fears.We began to see that we were ambivalent because we still found it difficult to believe that our bodies, which always seemed to invite trouble, could protect us. We slowly understood that karate breaks down the division between body and mind. As Maggie Lomax writes: ‘Karate gives you a positive attitude towards your body as something to use with your mind.’We asked the women whether they worried about displaying and experiencing anger and aggression. One or two said that it had taken them at least a year before they could actually fight and even then they had immense inhibitions at sparring with other women in case they hurt them.But the point about karate is that it both releases and focuses anger and energy. Mary described how before karate she rarely directed her anger at the cause of her fury: ‘If someone irritated me I’d take it out on everyone else - often quite unaware of what I was doing. Now I recognize my anger and concentrate it.’Barbara agrees, saying that since learning karate she has actually fought less. ‘Karate makes you feel confident you can deal with a violent situation without becoming aggressive. The emotions don’t come into karate; it’s like mathematics. When you fight you work out clinically the best way to immobilize your opponent.’Once women start externalizing and focusing their anger, their fantasies change. ‘It’s good to imagine what you’d do in a fight.’ commented one woman who fantasizes about defending herself instead of being injured or raped. But for women who’ve always seen themselves as receptive and generous, this can be disturbing. ‘It’s horrible to be confronted with what feels like sadism in yourself,’ says Margaret. ‘Women doing karate really need to do consciousness raising on the existence and implication of such fantasies - at least then they’d know they weren’t alone.’1 Most breast cancers appear after forty, but something like 18 per cent of cases are in women under forty-five.2 Doctors are required to ask permission and you have the right - if you dare - to refuse.3 Hans O.

The seminar on the psychology of dying that she initiated in Chicago ten year ago has involved doctors, nurses, medical students, social workers, physiotherapists and chaplains. It is an attempt to 'refocus on the patient as a human being, to include him in our dialogues, to learn from him the strengths and weaknesses of our hospital management of the patient. We have asked him to be our teacher.'7 A couple of weeks after her death Joan's consultant wrote to me: 'Did our meetings before she died help? I do hope so. I think we all came to understand things a little better.'8 'When our patients reached the stage of acceptance and final decathexis [detachment], interference from outside was regarded as the greatest turmoil and prevented several patients from dying in peace and dignity. It is the signal of imminent death and has allowed us to predict the oncoming death in several patients where there was little or no indication for it from a medical point of view' - Kubler-Ross, On Death and Dying.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sexuality		278Health		347Violence		380
